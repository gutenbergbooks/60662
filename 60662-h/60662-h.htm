</div>

<p class='c007'>The opening pages of this book contain, so one may hope,
an adequate answer to the objections of those who may have
been led by its title to expect a more detailed treatment of
poetic origins and a closer study of such questions as the
early forms of rhythm, the beginnings of national literatures,
and the actual history of lyric, epic, and drama. Not these
problems have been undertaken, interesting and important
as they are, but rather the rise of poetry as a social institution;
whether or not a definite account of this process has
been obtained must be left for the reader to judge.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />PURPOSE AND METHOD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is the object of the following pages neither to defend
poetry nor to account for it, but simply to study it as a social
institution. Questions of its importance, of the place which
it has held, or ought to have held, in the esteem of men, and
of the part which it is yet to play, are interesting but not
vital to one who is bent upon the investigation of it as an
element in human life. A defence is doubtless needed now
and then by way of answer to the pessimist like Peacock, or
to the moralist, the founder of states ideal or real, like Plato
and Mahomet. Scattered about the Koran are hints that
verse-making folk, like the shepherd’s turncock, are booked
for an unpleasant future, although it is well known that the
prophet in earlier days had been very fond of poetry; while
Plato himself, if one may believe his editors, began as a poet,
but took to prose because the older art was declining; with
the change he turned puritan as well, and saw no room for
poets in his ideal state. Attacks of this sort, however, are as
old as poetry itself, which, like “the service, sir,” has been
going to the dogs time out of mind, and very early formed
the habit of looking back to better days. For mediæval relations
these remembered arguments of Plato, backed by a
band of Christian writers, had put the art to its shifts; but
Aristotle’s fragment<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> served the renaissance as adequate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>answer, and it is interesting to note that the champion of
poetry in Aristotle long outlived the philosopher.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Petrarch,
taking the laurel, was moved to defend poetry against her
foes, and yet found, as critics find now, that she had come by
some of her worst wounds at the hands of her votaries; for
who, in any age, as Goethe asked and answered in his <i>Divan</i>,
“Who is driving poetry off the face of the earth?—The
poets.” Certainly not the philosophers and men of science,
though that is the common belief. Lefebvre,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> in 1697,
thought that he had given poetry its mortal blow when he
attacked it in the name of morals and of science; and his
onslaught is worth the notice if only to show how little
Renan and others urge to-day which has not been urged at
any time since Petrarch. Selden,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Newton, Bentham, have
been among the scoffers; so, too, Pascal. As to Newton, “A
friend once said to him, ‘Sir Isaac, what is your opinion of
poetry?’ His answer was, ‘I’ll tell you that of Barrow; he
said that poetry was a kind of ingenious nonsense.’”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> All
this is no more than disrespectful allusion to the equator,
jocose moments of the learned; yet it is quoted very seriously
by those who think to preach a funeral sermon over the
poetic art. So that when Renan expects to see poetry swallowed
up by science, and when it is said that Goethe, born a
century later, would throw poetry to the winds and give full
play to his scientific genius, that Voltaire would live altogether
for mathematics, and that Shakspere himself, “the
great psychologist,” would “leave the drama of humanity for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the drama of the world,” abjure wings, and settle to the
collar with psychical research folk and societies for child-study,—even
then the friends of poetry need feel no great
alarm; all this, allowing for conditions of the time, was said
long ago, and has been repeated in the dialect of each
generation. As for the past of poetry, kings have been its
nursing fathers and queens its nursing mothers; and for its
future, one may well be content with the words of the late
M. Guyau, a man of scientific training and instincts, who has
looked carefully and temperately at the whole question and
concludes<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a> that “poetry will continue to be the natural language
of all great and lasting emotion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Vindication apart, there is the art of poetry, the technique,
the Horatian view; and with this treatment of the subject
the present work has as little to do as with defence and
praise. From Vida even to Boileau writers on poetry were
mainly concerned to teach the art, and seemed to assume
that every bright boy ought to be trained as a poet. With
this idea went the conception of poetry as sum and substance
of right living and embodiment of all learning, sacred and
profane,—witness not only the famous lines of Milton, but
a part of the epitaph which Boccaccio composed for his own
tomb: <i>studium fuit alma poesis</i>. J. C. Scaliger, when that
early enthusiasm of the renaissance had begun to wane, turned
from art to science; his son and Casaubon and the rest took
up the work of research and let the art of poetry languish.
On this scientific ground, where, in spite of the overthrow of
Aristotelian authority, in spite of changes in method and a
new range of material, one may still learn much from these
pioneers, there are now three ways by which one can come
to poetry from the outside, and regard it not technically but
in the spirit of research: there is the theory of poetic impulses
and processes in general; there is the criticism of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>poems and poetry as an objective study; and there are the
recording, the classifying, and the comparing of the poetic
product at large. The present work belongs to this third
division, and in its method must keep mainly within historical
and comparative bounds. It is not concerned in any way
with the poetic impulse, or with the poem as object of critical
study; it regards the whole poetic product as a result of
human activity working in a definite field. This must be
clearly understood. At the outset of an attempt to throw
some light upon the beginnings of poetry, it is well to bear
in mind that by poetry is meant, not the poetic impulse, but
the product of that impulse, and that by beginnings are
meant the earliest actual appearances of poetry as an element
in the social life of man, and not the origins or ultimate
causes, biologically or psychologically considered, of poetic
expression. What the origin of poetry may have been, and
to what causes, however remote, in the body and life of man
must be attributed the earliest conceivable rhythmic utterance,
are questions for a tribunal where metaphysics and
psychology on the one hand, and biology on the other
hand, have entered conflicting claims. As for biology, until
one has found the source of life itself, it is useless to follow
brain dissections in an effort to discover the ultimate origins
of poetry. To be sure, psychology has a legitimate field of
inquiry in discussing the source of æsthetic manifestations;<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
and going deeper into things, it would be pleasant if one
could lay hold of what philosophers call “the germinal
power of whatever comes to be,” the <i>keimkraft des seienden</i>;
but times are hardly ripe for such a feat. Even Weismann<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
concedes a “soul,” a capacity not yet explainable, for appreciating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>music, and, by implication, poetry. It is better in
the present state of things to assume poetry as an element
in human life, and to come as close as possible to its primitive
stages, its actual beginnings. What these beginnings of
poetry were, in what form it first made a place for itself
among human institutions, and over what paths it wandered
during the processes of growth and differentiation even in
prehistoric times, are questions belonging to the answerable
part of that catechism about his own life which man has
been making and unmaking and making again ever since he
began to remember and to forecast. We have here no concern
with the perplexing question why æsthetic activity was
first evolved; it is quite another matter when we undertake
to learn how æsthetic activity made itself seen and felt. In
brief, to seek the origins of poetry would be to seek the
cause of its existence as a phenomenon, to hunt that elusive
<i>keimkraft des seienden</i>; to inquire into the beginnings of
poetry is to seek conditions and not causes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nothing, however, is harder than to carry out this simple
plan; from a work on poetry take away both theory and
criticism, and what is left? It is true that since F. Schlegel,
a hundred years ago, said<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> of art in general that its science
is its history, historical and comparative treatment of poetry
has come speedily to the fore; but that mystery which
rightly enough clings to a poetic process, the traditions of
sanctity which belong to genius, and the formidable literature
of æsthetics, have all worked together to keep the study of
poetry out of line with the study of other human institutions,
and to give it an unchartered freedom from the control of
facts which has done more harm than good. Consider that
touch of futility which vexes the mind when it sets about discussion
of a topic so far from the daily business of life; consider
the great cloud of witnesses who can be summoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>from any library to prove that of all printed silliness nothing
reaches quite so silly a pitch as twaddle about the bards;
add, too, that no process is so difficult to observe and analyze
as the making of a poem; and it is easy to see why
writers on poetry are always flying to cover in psychology
and æsthetics or in criticism.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Facing the facts of poetry,
a scholar can treat the poetic impulse and keep the facts at
arm’s length, or even quite out of his range. Treating the
poetic product, whether genetically or historically or comparatively,
tracing the evolution of poetry as a whole, for
its own laws of growth and decay, or regarding its place as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>an institution in human society, he must hold unbroken commerce
with a bewildering mass of material. Hence the delight
which animates to their task the numberless writers
of “thoughts about poetry,” and the dismay with which
the historian looks upon his rough and unwieldy subject.
Books beyond the power of any modern reader to compass
have been written on the poetic impulse; while all the
books which treat the poetic product as an element of public
life could be carried in one’s pocket,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a>—and one need
be no Schaunard for the task. Yet the facts of poetry
ought to precede the theory,—facts, moreover, that should
be brought into true relations with the development of social
man. A record of actual poetry;  then a history of its beginnings
and progress as an achievement of human society;
then an account of it with regard to its origin and
exercise as a function of the individual mind,—such is the
process by which there could have been built up a clear
and rational science of poetry, the true poetics. <i>Dis aliter
visum.</i> There is a fairly good record of poetry, with gaps
due to chance and neglect, many of which chance and energy
may yet combine to fill. As an achievement of human society,
poetry has had scant attention;  and the present work is
intended, in however modest and imperfect performance, to
supply material and make an outline for such a study.</p>

<p class='c013'>With such an object in view, and in such a spirit, what is
the method by which one is to come at the beginnings of
poetry, and what material is one to employ?  Literature
itself, and the comparative, historical method, are indicated
by the very terms of the quest; but what of other aids?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>There is no doubt that science has opened mines of research
unknown to a former generation of scholars in poetics; what
have zoology, physiology, psychology, ethnology, anthropology,
sociology, to say to the beginnings of rhythmic utterance?
From the study of those animals which stand nearest
to man in intelligence and social instincts there should come
in course of time a better knowledge of the physical conditions
under which primitive folk essayed their earliest poetry; but
it is conceded that the present state of these studies, even in
obvious cases like the singing of birds and the social dances
and amusements of sundry animals, offers scant help to the
student of poetry, and often leads him into absurdities. Darwin’s
suggestion that the lyric poem might in some way go
back to the call of the male <i>homo</i> to the female at mating
time, induced Scherer to put the origins of poetry in general
upon this purely biological basis;<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> but Scherer’s enthusiasm
has met no hearty response and seems to fly in the face of
certain important facts. The book of Groos, to which further
reference will be made, gives a better series of analogies with
the subject in hand, but is not to be used in any positive or
conclusive way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Help of a more substantial kind can be found in the researches
of modern psychology; and indeed, when these
shall have been put in available form, they will greatly
increase the materials for a study of the poetic process. To
what extent the study of the poetic product, however, may use
such aids, is a quite different question. For example, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>is one doctrine, which, if it were established upon an absolute
and universal truth, could be applied to the problem of primitive
verse with such success as to throw a bridge over the
chasm between what is recorded and what is unrecorded, and
so lead one cannily into the midst of the unknown. The theory
was laid down by Haeckel<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> that “ontogenesis, or the
development of the individual, is a short and quick repetition”—or
recapitulation—“of phylogenesis, or the development
of the tribe to which it belongs, determined by the laws
of inheritance and adaptation.” Schultze, in his excellent
book on fetishism,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a> uses this law, if law it be, in determining
the mental state of primitive folk; “what is true of the child
is true of the wild man, whose consciousness is in the childish
embryonic stage,” and who has reached the fetishistic epoch
of mental growth. A savage who gets a clock wants to wrap
it in costly furs; so does a child. Professor Baldwin, too,
accepts the principle as a guide in working out analogies
between the development of the child and the development
of the race, of society.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> For example, the consciousness
of the “I” in children seems analogous in point of
development to the individual consciousness of primitive
man; and it is evidently of value to the student of early
poetry to find his conclusion that such poetry is mainly
impersonal backed by testimony from those who have studied
the inner life of infants and children to the effect that fear,
anger, likes and dislikes, are emotions that precede perception
of the subject’s own personality. A. W. Schlegel used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>this analogy a hundred years ago;<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> and, before him, Gottsched,
who had far keener historic sense than one would suppose,
explained early epic by the curiosity which children show
in their demand for tales of every sort, adding that “primitive
folk were exactly like these little creatures, who have no
experience and such store of curiosity.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a> In fact, as is so often
the case with a new exact theory in science, the general idea
has been a commonplace time out of mind. Shelley, declaring
that “the savage is to ages what the child is to years,” is
echoing eighteenth-century thought, with its idea of humanity
passing from childhood to riper growth; and Turgot and
Condorcet<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a> only added the notion of human perfectibility and
infinite development to an analogy which was first made, so it
would seem, by the Italian Vico. The parallel is everywhere;
Macaulay uses it in his theory of poetic degeneration,
Peacock in his <i>Four Ages</i>, and Victor Hugo in the preface to
<i>Cromwell</i>. Not as an idea, but as a formula, Mr. Spencer
makes the biological doctrine of recapitulation a part of his
sociological system. Professor Karl Pearson appeals to the
same doctrine when he wishes to say a word for the matriarchate;<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
in the life of the child, he notes, “the mother and
the woman play the largest part; and so it is in the religion
and social institutions of primitive man.” Thus a child’s
world reproduces the primitive world; and the <i>märchen</i>,
where witches are still powerful though hated and malignant
beings, show what is really the priestess of early matriarchal
cult fallen into disfavour under patriarchal conditions. Or,
finally, to choose an unexceptionable case, Professor Bücher,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
noting that long-continued and laborious activity is easily
kept up provided it pass as play and not as labour, takes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the dances of savages, and the games of a civilized child,
as analogous to the efforts of earliest man. It is true, too,
that savages, and presumably early man, are like the child in
quick alternations of mood, in the possibility of laughter and
tears at once, in many traits of the kind; so far Letourneau<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
is perfectly right in his parallel. Now all these cases, in
varying degree, are meant as arguments from analogy, and,
as is usual when one deals with analogy, may be regarded as
more or less desirable aids to evidence that is direct. By
itself, however, analogy must not be conclusive; in the matter
under consideration it cannot be regarded as proof; and alone
this rule of ontogenesis and phylogenesis is not enough to
bridge the chasm and allow one to describe prehistoric poetry.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such, however, is precisely the task that some bold
pioneers have essayed. Letourneau, indeed, is hardly to be
placed in this category, although he upholds the doctrine
and puts it to use;<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a> for his conclusions are invariably fortified
by facts from ethnology and literature. But the author
of a book on primitive poetry, Jacobowski,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a> belongs here;
freed from all obligations of research, all study of actual
facts, he trips jauntily into the unknown, hand in hand with
this omnipotent theory as guide. True, he affects the scientific
habit of mind, and once refers the reader, for further
light on some difficult problem, to “my little essay on the
Psychology of a Kiss”; for he is by way of being a lyric
poet, and seems of the tribe of him whom Heine described
as “personal enemy of Jehovah, believing only in Hegel
and in Canova’s Venus,” save that one must here make the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>easy substitution of Haeckel for Hegel. So, too, Jacobowski
is a statistician, an observer, as witness that work on the
kiss, evidently in no spirit of Johannes Secundus; and he
gives incidental notes on the poetic process which have a
very scientific ring. “I know a young poet,” he says in a
burst of confidence, and perhaps remembering Goethe’s fifth
Roman elegy, “who actually makes his best poems in the
very ecstasy of wine and of love.” He draws a diagram, like
those convincing charts in history and political economy, to
illustrate the “hunger-curve” and the “thirst-curve,” and
to answer the question why there is so much poetry that
deals with drinking and so little that deals with eating.
Here and there a savage tribe is named, a traveller is invoked;
but Jacobowski’s main trust is in the human infant
and in his own poetic self. That the book has been taken
seriously is perhaps due to the only part of it worth considering,
which traces the origin of poetry to cries of joy or
of pain. This, of course, in great elaboration; by the ontogenetic
method one may study poetry, that is, emotional
expression, in the modern infant, and then by a simple
phylogenetic process “transfer the result to humanity.”
Rid of all friction from facts, literary and sociological, the
pace of proof is breathless, and pampered jades of investigation
are left far out of sight in the rear. What was the first
poem?—A cry of fright. Why?—All observers agree that
the first emotion noted in a child—as early, says Preyer, as
the second day—is fear. Watch by the cradle, then, and
note the infant’s gasps, cooings, gurglings, cryings, grimaces,
gestures; these will give in due succession the stages and
the history of literature. In this attitude, too, Jacobowski
watches for the “primitive lyric.” He quotes Preyer’s
account of a baby which, on the day of its birth, showed
pleasure at the presence of light and displeasure at relative
darkness. There follow more statistics of the same sort,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“lyrical sounds of delight,” heard from another baby for the
same reason. Now, says the author triumphantly, “precisely”—the
word is to be noted—“<i>precisely the same effect
of light and darkness must have been experienced by primitive
man</i>.”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a> It is hardly worth while to argue against such
an extreme of absurdity as this; the lyric expression of a
new-born baby’s pleasure in light and fear of darkness is no
parallel to the lyric and poetic expression of primitive man,
not only for the reason that overwhelming evidence shows
all primitive poetical expression of emotion to have been
collective, but because this emotion was based on very keen
physical perceptions. The analogy of infant growth in
expression with the development of primitive man’s expression
comes soon to wreck; who furnished for infant man
the adult speech, gesture, manner, upon which the imitative,
actual infant works in his progress through babyhood?
Moreover, the infant individual of an adult race and the
adult individual of an infant race still differ, <i>qua</i> infant
and adult, as human beings. Think of the adult savage’s
activity, his sight, his hearing, his powers of inference
from what he sees; put him with his fellows even into
primitive conditions; and then consider the claim that such
a wild man’s earliest poem, a lyric, must be analogous to the
first cry of pleasure or of pain uttered by the solitary infant
on the first dull perception, say of light or of hunger! Even
the biological analogy, pure and simple, will now and then
break down. It has been asserted that the male voice was
once far higher than now in point of pitch, phylogenetic
inference from the ontogenetic fact of the boy’s voice before
it deepens; but Wallaschek<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a> examines the facts in regard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>to this claim, and finds not only adverse evidence, but a constant
tendency to raise the pitch as one passes from oldest
times to the present. There is another law of relativity
than that to which the argument of child and race appeals,—not
how primitive poetry compares with modern emotional
expression, but how primitive poetry was related to the
faculty and environment of primitive man. Looked at in
this light, it might well appear that “simple expression of
joy,” or what not, is a gross misrepresentation of the lyric
in question, and that the relative childishness of savages,
and, as one argues, of primitive men generally, is not a positive
childishness with regard to the conditions of their life.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
In fine, the analogy and the principle are in the present state
of things useless for any direct inference about primitive
poetry. When the sequence of emotions and of emotional
expressions has been established for infant life, it will have
an interest for the student of early literature, and may even
give him substantial help by way of suggestion, corrective,
test. But to set up a provisional account of the origins and
growth of infant emotional expression, and then to transfer
this scheme to primitive culture as the origins and growth of
human poetry, is, on the face of it, absurd.</p>

<p class='c013'>Closely akin to the error which makes unwarranted use
of psychological theories is the abuse of ethnological facts.
True, the value of ethnology to the study of primitive poetry
is immense; until one hundred and fifty years ago,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a> the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>vital fault of writers on poetry lay in their neglect of what
John Evelyn calls “plaine and prodigious barbarisme,” and
even down to the present, this contempt for lower forms of
poetry vitiates the work of writers in æsthetics; nevertheless,
there is caution to be applied in arguments from the
modern savage as in those from the modern infant. Briefly
put, the notion is abroad that the lower one goes in the scale
of culture among living savage tribes, the nearer one has
come to actual primitive culture, to unaccommodated man, the
thing itself, as it was in the very beginning of human life;
but, unless great care be used, one will follow this path to
the utter confusion of progress and retrogression. All would
be easy work if one could accept the statement of Gumplowicz,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
that “So long as one unitary homogeneous group
is not influenced by or does not exert an influence upon another,
it persists in the original primitive state. Hence, in
distant quarters of the globe, shut off from the world, we find
hordes in a state as primitive, probably, as that of their forefathers
a million years ago.” Surely not as primitive; the
very terms of the phrase deny it; and even in the stagnation
of culture, through wastes of dull and unmeaning ages, man,
like men, grows old: <i>tacitisque senescimus annis</i>. Neither
individual nor tribal life can stand still. What one may properly
do with ethnological evidence is to note how certain
conditions of culture are related to the expression of human
emotion, and to conclude that the same conditions, for these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>are a stable quantity, would affect the emotional expression
of primitive man in a similar way, allowing, however,—and
here is the important concession,—for the different state of
the intellectual and emotional powers in an early and vigorous
tribal life as compared with the stagnant or degenerate life
of a belated culture.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a> Two pitfalls lurk under the analogy.
It will not do to argue directly from a sunken race back to
a mounting race found at the same level; again, it will not
do to argue that because the mounting race, when arrived
at its prime, has not a certain quality or function, that it
therefore never had such a quality or function.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a> If one will
but look at the thing honestly, what a brazen assumption it
is that this makeshift human creature is always learning but
never forgetting, always gaining but never losing, and that
man of to-day holds fast the unimpaired <i>x</i> of man’s primitive
powers along with all that change and growth and countless revolutions
have brought him! It is a mistake of the first order
to assume that a form of expression now unknown among
men must have been unknown to those who made the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>trials of expression as in words and song. One often hears
about the lost arts; it is quite possible that there were arts
or modes of expression used by primitive man for which one
can find no analogy to-day either among men of culture or
in savage tribes. There are rudimentary growths in literature,
and these must be taken into account just as the man
of science considers the nails or the hair or even the often-discussed
vermiform appendix. The pineal gland, which
Descartes finally chose as the scene of that mysterious passage
between soul and matter demanded by his system of
philosophy, has been recently explained to be all that is left
of an eye in the top of the head. This may be a true account
of the pineal gland, or a false account; but no competent
naturalist will assert that civilized man has all the bodily
functions which he had at that remote period in question.
So, too, with certain possible distorted survivals in poetry of
forms of emotional expression now unknown; it is wrong
to deny them, and it is perilous to assert them unless cumulative
evidence of many kinds can establish the probability.
Again, for the first of these two warnings, it is unfair to set
up the Australian black fellow or the Andaman islander,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a>
with his “primitive” tools, dress, habits, and then, by a forcing
of the adjective, bid us look at our primitive ancestor. No
one denies the value of ethnological evidence; Thucydides
himself declared that barbarous nations gave one a good idea
of what civilized nations had been; accounts of savage life
have the enormous advantage of coming close to the conditions
of primitive life; but they do not give us the infallible
description of primitive man himself, and it is an illicit process
to transfer a quality from savage to ancestor, to say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>that man at the dawn of history was like this belated specimen,
and that tribes from whose loins sprang dominant races,
races which fought, and spoiled, and set up civilizations now
vanished from almost every kind of record, can be reconstructed,
in each feature of mind and body, by a study of
peoples long ago shunted upon the bypaths of progress.
Mr. Spencer was one of the first to protest against this abuse
of ethnology.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Professor Grosse,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a> on the other hand, makes
a strong and candid effort to meet and minimize the objections
to an assumption upon which his whole study of
primitive art depends. He asserts that arguments in opposition
rest on the theory of degradation, and he denies that
degradation has taken place, pointing to the remarkable uniformity
of culture conditions in the various tribes which he
regards as primitive. But it is clear that one does not need
the theory of degradation to make good the point which has
just been urged. Grant that these savage tribes have not
degenerated; they have certainly failed, in every important
particular, to progress; they are stunted; and they compare
with that primitive being who held the destinies of culture
in his hand, who pressed forward, wrought and fought, and
sang the while of what he did, somewhat as a dwarf idiot of
forty compares with a healthy child of four. More than this.
Long stagnation, while it cannot push culture to new habits,
may well complicate and stiffen the old habits to such an
extent that the latter state of them comes quite out of analogy
with the beginnings. For example, the festal dances of the
savage are often intricate to a degree, requiring real erudition
in the teacher, and infinite patience and skill in the disciple.
Now it needs no advance in culture, no change in the form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>of production, which is Grosse’s test for culture, to make
this dance progress from wild rhythmic leapings in a festal
throng to the rigid form it has found under the care of certain
experts. The earliest dancers and the latest dancers,
communal and artistic, may have lived the same tribal life
and got their food by the same kind of hunting, the same
rude gathering of plants. In fact, startling as the assertion
may seem, and however it may run counter to this convenient
law that the degree of culture depends on the form of production,
and that the work of art depends on the degree of
culture, it is nevertheless highly probable that a certain combination
of dance and song used among the Faroe islanders
about a century ago, and recorded by a Danish clergyman
who saw it, is of a far more primitive type than sundry
laborious dances of savage tribes who are assumed to be
quite primitive in their culture.</p>

<p class='c013'>Granted the need to use the analogy with caution, it is well
to note how wary one must be in dealing with the evidence
itself. The warning may be brought home by an illustration
somewhat out of the beaten track of ethnological material.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
Nearly a century ago, Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill, United States
senator from New York, was “a sort of permanent chairman
of the committee on Indian affairs”; and he gives an account
of a song “in the Osage tongue,” which was sung at his
house in Washington, “translated into French by Mr.
Choteau, the interpreter, and rendered into English immediately,
January 1, 1806.” It is well to see what came of this
process in the shape of the song “On War.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>Say, warriors, why, when arms are sung,</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>There is more in the same pensive but smooth and elegant
vein; and one regrets to learn that this excellent Wanapaska,
who would have pleased Chateaubriand, “died suddenly ...
a few nights after having sung this song to the translator,”—who,
however, unblushingly lived on. But he could be truthful
on occasion, this translator, and he tells the truth about
two Cherokee songs of friendship which may not have seemed
capable of conversion into tender English monody. Here is
silly sooth. The songs, one is told, “consist of but one sentence
each with a chorus. Nothing of greater length seems
to exist among” the Cherokees. “They repeat the song and
chorus until they are tired. The words of both were written
for me<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a> by Mr. Hicks, a Cherokee of the half blood, with his
own hand, both original and version.... <i>Neither among
the Osages nor the Cherokees could there be found a single
poetical or musical sentiment founded on the tender passion
between the sexes.</i> Though often asked, they produced no
song of love.”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a> The two songs follow,—they have the same
chorus and belong together,—with interlinear translation:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>Can, nal, li, èh, ne-was-tu.</div>

      <div class='line in14'>Brothers I think we are.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And the chorus, as before. Now even the humblest student
of poetry can sift all this evidence, on the face of it equally
valuable throughout, and find that a part of it is worse than
worthless, while another part is of real value; in many cases,
however, the task is difficult, and this for two reasons. Either
the missionaries, explorers, travellers, give only a partial
account, or again, they give accounts of a misleading sort, if
not actually untrue. For the former case, we may take Ellis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and his description of a New Zealand dance.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a> “Several of
their public dances seemed immoral in their tendency; but in
general they were distinguished by the violent gestures and
deafening vociferations of the performers.” And that is all.
It is enough for the purposes of the book, but it is not enough
for the student of poetry. Worse yet is the tendency to state
savage thought, savage habits, in terms of civilization, and so
give a notion never true and often false. When, for example,
one is told<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a> that in the South Sea islands there are poets who
retire at certain seasons from the world in order to live in
solitude and compose their poems, one is surprised at this
notion of poetical composition among races where the great
mass of evidence is for improvised songs of a line or two,
with eternal chorus—savage pattern everywhere—and with
accompanying dance. However, here is the evidence, and it
must be taken with the rest. Presently comes an actual
song,<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a> a pensive song, by one of these bards and akin to the
Osage outburst translated by Dr. Mitchill:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Death is easy.</div>
      <div class='line'>To live, what boots it?</div>
      <div class='line'>Death is peace.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Is this a Fijian Schopenhauer, or rather Leopardi; or does
it mean contact with civilized thought and with Christian
hymns? Before one accepts this as outcome of “primitive”
poetic conditions, one must bring it into line with the poetry
from such sources on which all evidence is agreed; at once
the bard and his ditty fall under strong suspicion. Witty proverbial
verses found in half-civilized tradition, say among the
Finns,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a> get the same label of “primitive,” until one appeals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>to the chronological sense of fitness, and to other kinds of
evidence:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Praise no new horse till to-morrow,</div>
      <div class='line'>No wife till two years are over,</div>
      <div class='line'>No wife’s brother till the third year,</div>
      <div class='line'>Praise thyself not while thou livest!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>At this rate the letters of some Lord Chesterfield to his
son will yet be reconstructed for the epoch of our hairy
ancestors on the tree platform. It is clear that the great
body of ethnological evidence, unequal in its parts, and in
sad need of sifting and revision, has something of that uncertain
quality as an ally in argument which Tom Nash imputed
to “law, logic, and the Switzers.” They could be hired to
fight, he said, for anybody.</p>

<p class='c013'>Safety lies in making one kind of evidence control another
kind, and in reckoning only with the carefully balanced
result. What evidence is there that can control the evidence
of ethnology? Philology, despite its overweening
claims, is said to be unavailing; it may reveal verbal processes
which belong to prehistoric times; but, as J. F. McLennan<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a>
remarked, “in the sciences of law and society,
old means not old in chronology but in structure.... The
preface of general history must be compiled from the
materials presented by barbarism.” Yet McLennan himself
declares that “a really primitive people nowhere exists,” and
so puts a great restriction on the use of the material he has
just praised. Can history be of help? “The study of the
science of art,” says Professor Grosse,<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a> “should not turn to
history or to prehistory. History knows no primitive peoples.”
Archæology, he thinks, is as powerless; the sole
refuge is in ethnology, for it shows us “a whole series of
primitive peoples in the full light of the present.” But this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>full light, now and then, has blinded even Professor Grosse;
and there is a kind of history, not direct, indeed, not a matter
of clear record, but still often as valuable as ethnological
evidence, which has help of its own for the student of primitive
institutions both by way of control and by way of suggestive
facts. One of the first men who went about the
reconstruction of prehistorical times by a sober application
of the “known principles of human nature” to the facts
offered by ethnology and sociology, sciences then unknown
by name, was Adam Smith; in the highly interesting account
of him written by Dugald Stewart and published as introduction
to the Essays,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a> the name of “<i>theoretical</i> or <i>conjectural
history</i>” is given to “this species of philosophical investigation
which has no appropriated name in our language.” Stewart
is speaking of Smith’s essay on the origin of speech,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a> and
compares it with the famous pioneer work of Montesquieu
and others in a related field of study, remarking on the way
in which “casual observations of illiterate travellers and
navigators” are combined into “a philosophical commentary
on the history of law and of manners.” These “casual
observations” have risen of late to almost absolute power,
and “known principles of human nature” are out of office.
Now it is true that one must be chary in the application of
such “known principles” to the facts from which one has
to construct one’s idea of human nature itself, a process
close to the vicious circle; but there are, nevertheless, certain
general controlling ideas to which appeal should be made
when one has to set a value on a given bit of evidence. A
controlling idea of this sort is the sense of literary evolution,
an idea based on known literary facts, and quite valid as test
for alleged facts which are brought forward as evidence in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>questions of prehistoric stages of poetry. This sense of literary
evolution, moreover, need be no whim or freak of one’s own
judgment. It is not merely that one feels the absurdity of
those jingling platitudes which Dr. Mitchill fathers upon the
lorn Wanapaska; it is the sense of evolution in the expression
of emotion and of thought, a sense based on experience
and due to a competent process of reasoning, which tells
any person of information that savages do not make such a
song. True, if a mass of such evidence lay before one, and
it proved to be of the trustworthy sort, then the controlling
idea would be driven off, and the old sense of evolution
would be so modified as to conform to the new facts. But
this is not the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>The controlling idea, the sense of evolution, should be an
object for the scholar in more limited fields than heretofore
have been chosen for his work. It will be found wise, henceforth,
to select a narrower path but a more distant goal, a
smaller subject and a larger method, to run down a single
clew, and to run it, if possible, to the end. Works on the
History of Human Thought, on the History of Literature, of
Religion, of Civilization, on Primitive Culture, were great in
their day,—and probably no one book, apart from Darwin’s,
has had such a wide and wholesome influence as that masterpiece
of Dr. E. B. Tylor; they initiated, fixed the general
direction, were the doing of genius. But the day of discoveries
has gone by, and colonization, a slower process, is
rather an affair of hard if intelligent work. Histories, if the
term will pass, are needed for the different functions of
human expression and human emotion itself. The whimsical
Nietzsche<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a> has called for histories “of Love, of Avarice, of
Envy, of Conscience, of Piety, of Cruelty”; but apart from
his notions, and for sober purposes of literary study, there is
need for such work as a history of sentiment, and this, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>course, should be followed back on its different lines of expression.
Two striking passages in Mr. Thomas Hardy’s <i>Return
of the Native</i> may be cited here as bearing on possibilities of
investigation which need not be regarded as fantastic or absurd.
In describing the face of his hero, as one that bore traces of
a mental struggle, a half-formed query in regard to the value
of existence, Mr. Hardy contrasts this face, so common now
in every walk of life, with the countenance preserved by
sculpture from an age when no such questions haunted the
brain, and when, to use his phrase, man “could still revel in
the general situation.” Even more suggestive is the other
passage, which treats the change of sentiment in regard to
what are called “the beauties of nature.” Much has been
said and investigated of late on this attitude, ancient and
modern, toward nature;<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a> but there is metal more attractive
in Mr. Hardy’s introduction of Egdon Heath as a sort of
tragic character in his story, and in his remark that with the
saddening of life men have turned more and more from mere
gardens and green meadows, and have sought wild, rugged
scenes; in days to come, indeed, they may turn even from
the barren coasts of the sea, from bleak mountains, and seek
stretches of absolute desolation, forbidding, featureless, dead,
to suit their mood and give them rest from the stress of life.
These are hints, false or true, only hints; but if they can
so stir one to look into the seeds of time for the sake of
mere prediction, is there not sober gain in a reversal of this
process and in a study of the conditions and expressions of
sentiment as far back as one can follow them? It is said
that the absence and the presence of personal sentiment
respectively condition the poetry of France that precedes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Villon and the poetry that comes after him; what of the
larger field, poetry itself, with regard to this important quality
in emotional expression? Can one do for poetry what a
recent writer<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a> has done for civic life? Speaking of altruism,
and noting the original absence of sentiment, he constructs
a curve, or, as he calls it, a gradation, “the first word of which
is selfishness and the last public sentiment.” What curves,
now, can be constructed in poetry which shall prove of value
as showing a controlling idea and warranting a sense of evolution?
Clearly, these controlling ideas in a history of literature
must stand chiefly upon the facts of literature, and the sense
of evolution must be based upon a study of literary changes
and growth, the play and result of such elements as have just
now been described. The sense of evolution in literature is
akin to the genealogical point of view lately urged upon
critics by M. Brunetière,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a> but it is not the same thing; with
him the doctrine of evolution is applied to literature or to art
as a safe guide through its chronology, as a clew to its progress
and retrogressions, as a discovery of the relations which
a genius bears to those who went before him and to those
who follow, and as a test of the valid and the permanent in
art. The application of the sense of evolution now to be
considered has a far wider range and must lead in time to
wider conquests. For example, if one will choose some
particular characteristic of human nature and will essay, by
the aid of literature and the arts, to follow back the manifestations
of it to a point where all records and traces of it cease,
one will have a history of this characteristic,—and one will
have something more. There will be not only the actual record
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>made up from a series of observations which form a dotted
line from furthest historical past to present, but the dots of this
line, the line itself, will often form a curve which points either
to a general gain or to a general loss of the characteristic in
question. Or, if it is a case where one cannot speak with
exactness of a loss or a gain in the characteristic itself, the
curve will show loss or gain in any given form by which this
characteristic has made itself known. Here, in other words,
is a curve of relative tendencies; and the knowledge of such
a curve not only gives us that sense of evolution to which reference
has been made, but justifies us, after careful study and testing
of these dotted facts, in a bold leap from the known to the
unknown. If the characteristic in question, from the point
where it comes into view at the beginning of records, shows
a constant curve of increase or of decrease, one is justified in
making a fairly definite statement about it in prehistoric
times. Now this is not the evolutionary doctrine championed
by M. Brunetière in literary research, for the reason that it
is not dealing with poets and poems, but with poetry, or
rather with the elements of poetry. To give a practical
illustration, it is found that ethnological evidence puts in
strong relief the almost exclusive and certainly overwhelming
frequency of choral singing among rudest savage tribes. If,
now, one takes a modern popular ballad and seeks to follow
it back in such a way as to join it, as the end of a long line
of survivals, to these primitive choral songs, one falls at once
into confusion and halts sooner or later before insuperable
barriers. Apart from the controversy about artistic or communal
origin, apart from the theories of the epic, of the <i>cante-fable</i>,
what not, it is out of the range of possible things to
trace ballad or folksong, as such, back to a primitive form.
Yet it seems to have occurred to no one that the way to treat
the ballad for historic, comparative, and genetic purposes is
to separate it into its elements, and to follow these elements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>back to the point where they vanish in the mists of unrecorded
time. Such elements—and, unlike the ballad itself, they can
be traced—are the fact of singing, the fact of dancing, the
fact of universal improvisation, the fact of a predominant
chorus or refrain. Are these elements, as far back as one
can trace them, stronger, more insistent, as one approaches
primitive conditions? What is the curve of evolution? Add
to it the evidence of ethnology, and the conclusions of sociology,
in regard to the composition and character of the early
social group: here are materials which are solid enough to
bear the weight of certain and definite conclusions in regard
to the communal element in earliest verse. Again, there is
another curve to consider. The poem of our day is mainly
individual and artistic; how far back, and in what degree,
waxing, waning, or stationary, can these elements be traced,
and with what ethnological and sociological facts can they
be confronted? The differencing characteristics of the poetry
of art, and those of the poetry which is rightly or wrongly
called communal, must be studied for themselves and traced
back in their curves of evolution in order to ascertain what
part they played in the beginnings of the art. And thus, too,
the question must be answered, a question neither idle nor
without wide sweep of interest, whether poetry has been one
and the same element of human life from the outset, under
varying circumstances, indeed, but under fixed conditions and
with stable elements, or whether the conditions and the
elements are now different from those which obtained at the
start.</p>

<p class='c013'>The method, then, of this attempt to study the beginnings
of poetry is not to transfer outright the facts and conditions
of savage life, result of ethnological investigation, to primitive
song, not to take a supposed “popular” or communal
poem of modern tradition and essay a somewhat similar
transfer, but rather to use the evidence of ethnology in connection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>with the progress of poetry itself, as one can trace it
in the growth or decay of its elements. The facts of ethnological
research have been largely digested and can be easily
used. The elements of poetry, in the sense here indicated,
and combined with sociological considerations, have never
been studied for the purpose of determining poetic evolution;
and in this study lie both the intention of the present
book and whatever modest achievement its writer can hope
to attain. Before, however, this actual study is begun, two
propositions must be established: the writer must prove that
what he takes as poetry is poetry in fact; and, as was hinted
just above, he must show a clear title for his use of the terms
“communal” and “artistic.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />RHYTHM AS THE ESSENTIAL FACT OF POETRY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For the purposes of this book, poetry is rhythmic utterance,
rhythmic speech, with mainly emotional origin. One
must not write a book on poetry without essaying that <i>iter
tenebricosum</i> of a definition—a definition, too, that will
define, and not land the reader in a mere maze of words.
“Rhythmic speech” is a short journey, puts one on solid
ground at the end, and brings about no doublings and evasions
in the subsequent path of investigation. It says what
Robert Browning says in his summary of his art:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“What does it all mean, poet?—Well,</div>
      <div class='line'>Your brains beat into rhythm....”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>By rhythmic must be understood a regular recurrence which
clearly sets off such speech from the speech of prose; and
by speech is meant chiefly the combination of articulate
words, although inarticulate sounds may often express the
emotion of the moment and so pass as poetry. The proportionate
intellectual control of emotion in this utterance is a
matter of human development, and largely conditions the
course of poetry itself. We agree, then, to call by the name
of poetry that form of art which uses rhythm to attain its
ends, just as we call by the name of flying that motion which
certain animals attain by the use of wings; that the feelings
roused by poetry can be roused by unrhythmic order of
words, and that rhythmic order of words is often deplorably
bad art, or “unpoetic,” have as little to do with the case as
the fact that a greyhound speeding over the grass gives the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>spectator quite the exhilaration and sense of lightness and
grace which is roused by the flight of a bird, and the fact
that an awkward fowl makes itself ridiculous in trying to fly,
have to do with the general proposition that flying is a matter
of wings. A vast amount of human utterance has been
rhythmic; one undertakes to tell the story of its beginnings.
With such a definition the task is plain though hard; let go
this definition, and there is no firm ground under one’s feet.
The patron and the critic of poetry, to be sure, must make
deeper and wider demands; from the critical point of view
one must find the standard qualities of excellence to serve as
test in any given case, one must ascertain what is representative,
best, highest; poetry for the critic has its strength
measured by the strongest and not by the weakest link in
the chain. From the æsthetical point of view, again, poetry
must be defined in terms of the purely poetic impulse. On
the other hand, any comparative and sociological study must
find a definition wide enough for the whole poetic product,
whether of high or of low quality, whether due to this or to that
emotion. It needs a simple and obvious test for the material.
Now as a matter of fact, all writers on poetry take
rhythm for granted until some one asks why it is necessary;
whereupon considerable discussion, and the protest signed by
a respectable minority, but a minority after all, that rhythm
is not an essential condition of the poetic art. This discussion,
as every one knows, has been lively and at times bitter;
a patient and comprehensive review of it in a fairly impartial
spirit has led to the conclusion, first, that no test save
rhythm has been proposed which can be put to real use,
even in theory, not to mention the long reaches of a historical
and comparative study; secondly, that all defenders of
the poem in prose are more or less contradictory and inconsistent,
making confusion between theory and practice; and
thirdly, that advocates of a rhythmic test, even in abstract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>definition, seem to have the better of the argument. Indeed,
one might simply point to the actual use of the word
“poetry,” and be done. However the student and collector
may proclaim the rights of prose to count as poetry,
his history, his anthology, shows no prose at all, and he
meekly follows in practice the definition against which, in
theory, he was so fain to strive and cry. Of this, one example,
but a very remarkable example. Baudelaire, in the
preface to his <i>Poems in Prose</i>, speaks of one Bertrand<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a> as
his master in this art, and of a book, <i>Gaspard de la Nuit</i>,
as its masterpiece. This book,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a> praised highly by Sainte-Beuve,
this <i>fantaisie à la manière de Rembrandt et de Callot</i>,
as its subordinate title runs, makes occasion for a very bold
assertion, and apparently for a great innovation, by one of
the editors of a collection of French poetry.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a> “To admit a
prose writer,” he says, “into a poetic anthology needs to be
explained. It is certain there are poets in prose just as there
are prosers in verse,”—the dear old cry, the dear old half-truth!
Now Bertrand is “poet not only by his sentiment,
not only by the pomp and sublimity of his thought, ... but
by the very art itself” which he lavishes upon this poetic
prose. True, he wrote verses also in his <i>Gaspard</i>; but his
main work is an artistic marvel of prose. “Louis Bertrand
prosodie la prose....” Well, a fine defence for the prose-poet;
and one turns to the selections for an example of the
poetic prose, not only “main work,” but very rare work of
the writer, whose book is most difficult to obtain. And what
are the selections from the prose-poet? Two poems in the
most incorrigible verse! A sonnet, a <i>ballade</i>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“O Dijon, la fille</div>
      <div class='line'>Des glorieux ducs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Qui portes bequille</div>
      <div class='line'>Dans tes ans caducs,”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>a kind of refrain, and with the rime in -<i>ille</i> running through
all the eight stanzas; and there is no prose at all! <i>Wozu
der Lärm?</i> Why this thunder in the index? Why “admit
a prose-writer into a poetic anthology,” with all this ceremony,
only to ignore his prose and to print his verse?<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>It is to be noted, first of all, that in ignoring the test of
rhythm, so as to admit great men of letters like Plato and
Bacon to the poets’ guild, the advocates of prose fail to set
up any other satisfactory test. Sidney and Shelley, Arcadians
both who said noble things about their calling, are reckoned
as defenders of the poem in prose. As to the younger,
all men must feel more deeply and more lovingly about
poetry, for the reading of his essay on that art which “redeems
from decay the visitations of the divinity in man,”
memorable words indeed; but his more exact definition declares
poetry to be “the expression of the imagination.”
Nothing is said here of rhythm, for the good reason that
while rhythm can be praised in its own place, it must not be
a bar to claims which Shelley and his fellows deem important.
Yet how tender and how inconsistent is his rejection
of the rhythmic test! Rhythm is “created by that imperial
faculty whose throne is curtained within the invisible nature
of man”; and “the language of poets has ever affected a
sort of uniform and harmonious recurrence of sound, <i>without
which it were not poetry</i>.”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a> Well, is this not to set up rhythm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>as a test? No, for Bacon, as well as Plato, is to be counted
with the bards; and how shall this be done save by condemning
“the distinction between poets and prose writers as a
vulgar error,” and by a widening of rhythm, so that it shall
have no bounds, no necessary “traditional forms”? Thus
Plato and Bacon come in, and all hope of a definite, working
test of poetry goes out. Sidney, again, had in his day this
mingled tenderness and contempt for rhythm. “Rhyming
and versing” no more make a poet than a long gown maketh
an advocate; but the “senate of poets <i>hath chosen verse as
their fittest raiment</i>.” Presently, however, the exquisite
reason for prose in poetry is clear, when Sidney calls Xenophon’s
<i>Cyropædia</i> “an absolute heroical poem.” So, too,
there is a saving clause, which, by the way, nobody denies
in its simple form, in Ben Jonson’s well-known deliverance;
a poet “expresses the life of man in fit measures, number,
and harmony,” yet “not he that writeth in measures only,
but that feigneth and formeth a fable and writes things like
the truth.” Now the test of rhythm, which Ben does not
really deny, will work in practice; the test of imagination
will not work. Shelley, putting Plato with the poetic
sheep, thrusts Cicero, disciple of Plato, among the goats
of prose. Sound criticism, perhaps; but what is the formula?
And when one is asking, not whom one shall
regard as a poet,—that is, a great poet,—but what one
shall regard as poetry, as material to include in a survey
of the rise and progress of poetry at large, then the test
of imagination fails utterly. Sidney was defending his art;
“we are not mere rimers,” so he seems to say, “the root
of the matter is in us, and we are kin with the gods.”
J. C. Scaliger, who insisted on the test of rhythm, and
was called many a pretty name for his pains, had a science
of poetry in mind, a survey of it, and cast about for a
test that would work on earth without reference to celestial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>origins. The Abbé Dubos<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a> was not willing to think so
nobly of verse, and laid main stress on style,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a>—always granting,
to be sure, the conventional test of “genius.” Only
genius can unite in lofty degree within the limits of one verse
that “poetry of style” and that “mechanics of poetry” which
go to make up the ideal poem; however, it is this style that
serves as practical test. In short, put genius, or even imagination,
to the practical trial, and confusion reigns at once.
Shelley and many more make a poet of Plato; Sidney brings
in Xenophon. Coleridge,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a> insisting that all the parts of a
poem must support “the purposes and known influences of
metrical arrangement,” thus making rhythm a test, promptly
says it is not a test, after all, for along with Plato, both Bishop
Taylor and Burnet must be counted as of the bards. Beattie<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
calls <i>Tom Jones</i> and the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i> “the
two finest comic poems, the one epic, the other dramatical,
now in the world.” Emerson<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a> thinks Thomas Taylor the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Platonist “a better poet, or, perhaps I should say, a better
feeder to a poet, than any man between Milton and Wordsworth,”—excellent
second thought. Sir Thomas Browne
he regards as a poet. Brought face to face with rhythm,
Emerson hedges; as, indeed, all these good folk do. Goldsmith,<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
for example, in an unacknowledged essay, calls versification
“one of the criteria that distinguish poetry from prose,
yet it is not the sole means of distinction.” The Psalms of
David, and certain Celtic fragments in prose, “lay claim to
the title of poetry.” Hazlitt,<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a> speaking of “poetry in general,”
seems favourable to rhythm as a test. Poetry “combines
the ordinary use of language with musical expression”;
and “there is a near connection between music and deep-rooted
passion. Mad people sing.” Then the fear of simplicity
gets hold upon him, of postman’s rimes and the posy
in a ring; “all is not poetry that passes for such,” verse is
not absolutely the test; and he stops short of the inconsistency
by saying there are three works “which <i>come as near to
poetry as possible without absolutely being so</i>; namely, the
<i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c012'><sup>[61]</sup></a> and the <i>Tales of Boccaccio</i>.”
Such works are “poetry in kind, and <i>generally fit
to become so in name by being ‘married to immortal verse.’</i>”
Bagehot<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a> is quite as cautious; “the exact line,” he says,
“which separates grave novels in verse like <i>Aylmer’s Field</i>
or <i>Enoch Arden</i> from grave novels not in verse like <i>Silas
Marner</i> and <i>Adam Bede</i>, we own we cannot draw with any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>confidence.” This is to be deplored, perhaps, from Bagehot’s
point of view; but <i>Adam Bede</i> remains prose, and
<i>Enoch Arden</i> is commonly set down as poetry, and there an
end. Why, too, should Boccaccio’s Tales, or the <i>Pilgrim’s
Progress</i>, be married to immortal verse? Jeremy Taylor’s
beautiful bit of prose about the lark is as satisfying in its
own way as Shelley’s verses are; they are different ways,
and one wishes as little to turn one into verse as to turn the
other into prose. Dr. Johnson, who recognizes no poet till
“he has ... distinguished all the delicacies of phrase and
all the colours of words and has learned to adjust their different
sounds to all the varieties of metrical modulation,” yet
concedes that “perhaps of poetry as a mental operation
metre or music is no necessary adjunct,” brings out, with
his sturdy common sense, the clash of theory and practice.
<i>As a mental operation</i>, that is, as the poetic impulse and as a
matter of theory, poetry is not tested by rhythm; “it is, however,
by the music of metre,” he goes on to say, “that poetry
has been discriminated in all languages,”—in other words,
metre will serve as a practical test. Now this hedging, this
confusion of ideas, this facing one way in theory and another
way in practice, is due partly to a shame and partly to a tradition.
Where is the dignity of the art, if any Bavius can pin
this facile badge of rhythm to his coat and strut about a bard
in good standing? Ronsard had this scruple on his mind;
so had Sidney, so even comfortable Opitz, so, in spite of his
own definition, the elder Casaubon. Tradition of the humanists,
of days when poetry held in fee all science, all the gorgeous
east of wisdom itself, rules to this day, and keeps men
groping for a subtle and esoteric definition. Hence, too, a
series of futilities and contradictions in dealing with rhythm
as a component part of poetry.</p>

<p class='c013'>So one comes to the second argument for rhythm as the
test of poetry. Not only does the test of imagination fail to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>work, but all the defenders of prose poems fall into contradiction
and confusion so soon as they abandon the other test, so
soon as they undertake to put their ideas into any but a
protestant and academic form; moreover, this protest nearly
always rises from the wish to count as poetry some masterpiece
of prose. Take a few typical writers on the theme.
Baumgarten, the founder of æsthetics, wrote<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a> an essay in
which he undertook an exact definition of poetry, and finally
summed it up as <i>oratio sensitiva perfecta</i>, speech that is both
concrete,—calling up in the mind a distinct picture,—and
perfect. A few years later, in his <i>Aletheophilus</i>, he returns
to the quest, and asks what a poem really is. A poem, he
answers, is speech so charged with energy that it demands
metrical expression. Yet the more he ponders over the
quality of rhythm, which in the actual definition seemed imperative,
the less he feels inclined to insist upon such a test;
at last comes the inevitable concession of theory, and a piece
of prose—here it is <i>Télémaque</i>—is suffered to pass as a
poem. After all this conjuring and throwing about of Latin,
one looks for results and finds instead confusion. But Baumgarten
was a dull pedant; set genius to work; call up Friedrich
Schlegel, who is said to have been the first critic to study
the “poem in prose” as it deserved, and whose own performances
in <i>Lucinde</i> made more than one of the judicious grieve.
Poetry, he says in one place,<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c012'><sup>[64]</sup></a> demands rhythm; for only that
uniformity which lies in the corresponding succession of tones
can express the uniformity needed in all true art; yet again,<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c012'><sup>[65]</sup></a>
wishing to put Tacitus as well as Plato among the poets, he
makes his wise Lothario say that “<i>any art or science</i>” which
uses speech as its expression, works for its own sake, and is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>at its best, must be counted as poetry. But let this, too, pass
as eccentricity of genius; call upon some one who has both
genius and method,—say Schleiermacher, who lectured on
æsthetics in 1819,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a> and undertook to reduce to system and
clarity this matter of poetry in prose. To help matters, the
subject is halved; drama and epic are “plastic,” and can
dispense with rhythm, while lyric is “musical” from the start.
How came rhythm, then, into drama and epic? Chorus
explains the drama, but epic rhythm cannot rest on any such
original union of music and words; there must be an “inward”
reason. Why does “free” productivity in speech seek
after musical form? So one comes back to the difference
between poetry and prose, explained by the nature of human
speech; one draws a long breath and sets upon another
exhilarating run round the circle. Two extremes of speech
are possible,—when no syllable is accented at all, and when
all syllables are accented alike; this, of course, will not
differentiate poetry from prose. But speech alternates
accent and no-accent, arsis and thesis; done for logical
reasons this alternation makes prose, for musical reasons,
verse. In languages like the classical, where rhythmical
accent utterly neglects logical accent, there can be little
interference of prose with poetry; while in tongues like the
Germanic, where verse-accent and word-accent tend to agree,
it is easy for poetry to pass into prose. Doubtless this is
keen thinking; it explains in some degree why imaginative
prose is absent from the classics as compared with modern
drama and romance. But it will not do for a definition, and
Schleiermacher begins a subtle but ineffectual analysis of
poetry old and new. In a Greek drama there was mingling
of measures, now more and now less musical; in modern
drama this difference appears as a mingling of verse and
prose. But if one thinks of the greater musical element in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>classical verse, then the modern difference between poetry
and prose<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a> “<i>is not much greater than the difference in classical
poetry between epic and dramatic measures</i>.” Now what has
Schleiermacher really done for the matter in hand? For
comparative literature he has done a distinctly brilliant piece
of work; but, even apart from the fact that no really clear
idea of poetry in itself has been gained, the difference between
poetry and prose, and the function of rhythm, have not been
elucidated. It has not been shown, after all, whether rhythm
is or is not a necessary part of poetry. So one turns to the
modern scholar, to the student of poetry as an element in
human life, to one who studies it in the light of psychology;
but here is the same contradiction. Guyau, who thinks this
distinction of poetry and prose a problem of high importance,
is in one place<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a> quite confident that “poets” like Michelet,
like Flaubert,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a>—he who first of Frenchmen<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a> tried to give to
his words an echo of the sensations described, a vague onomatopœia,
and the wider hint of a general situation,—and like
Renan, “have been able to dispense with rhythm.” But
verse, he thinks, is permanent; it will be “the natural language
of all great and lasting emotions”; while in another
book,<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a> this excellent and lamented writer not only assigns to
rhythm an <i>importance capitale</i>, but calls it “the very mainstay
of poetic speech.” And here again is intolerable
confusion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Into this pit of contradiction have fallen even sane and
capable critics like A. W. Schlegel, and sober philologists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>like Wilhelm von Humboldt.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c012'><sup>[72]</sup></a> Nobody could be more distinctly
an advocate of the test of rhythm than the elder Schlegel
was in certain Letters, widely read in their day, on Poetry,
Metre, and Speech;<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a> if it be objected, he says, that outpourings
of a full heart ought not to be hemmed by rule, it is
answer enough to say that they always have been under this
control, and that, whatever the possibilities of the case, poetry
is and has been governed by rhythm. Rhythm is born with
poetry, and “whether by Ontario or by the Ganges,” where
poetry is, there too is rhythm. As for “the so-called poetic
prose,” Schlegel is very bitter; it “springs from poetic impotence,”
and it “tries to unite the prerogatives of prose and
poetry, missing the perfection of both.” Elsewhere,<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a> in an
amusing little dialogue, he sets Grammar and Poetry talking
after this wise: “You speak so simply!” says Grammar. “I
must,” answers Poetry, “in order to distinguish myself from
Poetic Prose!” And again,<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a> he likens prose-poetry to the
ostrich, which has a gait half flying, half running, and wholly
awkward. Even the dialogue of the drama needs rhythm; for,
thinks Schlegel, its style demands measured and regular movement
of verse. Master of translation, like Herder before him,
he is against the translation of verse save by verse itself; and
the context shows that he is looking upon verse as an indispensable
condition of poetry.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, however, in the lectures at Berlin Schlegel begins
to define poetry and to theorize about it, holding as he does
a brief for the romantic school, for those doctrines of freedom
which could not away with any sovereignty of measured
speech over the play of fancy and would have no set paths
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>through the “moon-flooded night of enchantment,” he turns
squarely upon the test of rhythm.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a> It is a crude notion of
the philistine, he declares, <i>eine bürgerliche meynung</i>, that whatever
is in verses is a poem. Nor is much mended by saying
only that can be called poetry which ought to be and has to
be composed in verse; of late a kind of poetry has come to
the fore which rejects verse entirely,—the romance, the
novel. And where is yesterday’s scorn for the poem in
prose?<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>This study of contradictions could be carried into many
another field; but it is time to consider a third point,—that
in actual argument defenders of the test of rhythm seem
really to come off better than their foes. These opponents
start in a fog, and fog besets them all their way. The main
authority to which they appeal is Aristotle; but over certain
passages<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a> in the <i>Poetics</i>, their point of departure, hangs a
haze of uncertainty if not of contradiction. It is doubtful
whether Aristotle really meant to say what champions of
poetry in prose declare him to have said; moreover, these
brave texts must be taken along with a brief but pregnant
passage in which he looks at origins and beginnings of
poetry, a passage which lends itself less readily to the purposes
of those who would sweep rhythm from the field. Indeed,
sundry say that this is not Aristotle’s meaning in the
brave text itself. “Language without metre,” observes
Whately,<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a> is a bad translation; it should be “metre without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>music.” Twining,<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a> one of the best commentators, refers to
that other passage, where one is told that “imitation being
natural to us, and ... melody and rhythm being also natural,
... those persons in whom, originally, these propensities
were the strongest, were naturally led to rude and extemporaneous
attempts, which, gradually improved, gave birth to
poetry.” Twining makes a judicious comment. “In this
deduction of the art from the mimetic and musical instincts,
Aristotle <i>includes verse in his idea of poetry</i>, which he at least
<i>considered as imperfect without it</i>. All that he drops, elsewhere,
to the disparagement of metre, must be understood
only comparatively: it goes no further than to say that imitation,
that is, fiction and invention, deserves the title of poetry,
or making, better than verse without imitation.” Elsewhere,
too, as Twining shows, Aristotle puts verse among the requisites
of poetry.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a> A good Aristotelian, J. C. Scaliger, a greater
man, by the way, than modern criticism concedes, who first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>in his time undertook a science of poetry and not a mere
guide to the art, who broke new ground, and who had at
least the instincts of historical and comparative method, is
squarely for the test of verse.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a> Poetry is imitation in verse.
In the opening sections of his work<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a> he calls the poet not so
much a maker of fiction as of verses,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a> defends rhythm almost
in Hamann’s phrase as the mother-tongue of man, derives
poetry from singing, and, with a touch of psychological
method, makes appeal to the child who must go to sleep with
song.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a> In the later sections,<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c012'><sup>[86]</sup></a> he vigorously attacks the idea
of poetry in prose. He is followed by another pioneer of the
historic treatment of dogma, G. J. Vossius, who, tossing to
the winds any notion that verse itself makes the poet, declares
that verse is nevertheless condition of the poetic work.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c012'><sup>[87]</sup></a>
For poetry was meant to be sung—the genetic consideration
has a strong and wholesome influence upon these men—and
how can that be sung which has no rhythm? Or take the
rhythm from the Iliads; they turn to mere “fabulous stories.”
Briefly, while metres without the aid of diction and
genius can make no poem, fiction—Aristotelian imitation—is
powerless without the help of verse. To the same purpose
and earlier, Isaac Casaubon; the test of poetry is rhythm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and any utterance which comes under metrical laws is so far
a poem.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c012'><sup>[88]</sup></a> Scaliger, Vossius, and Casaubon are “good”; and
their credit comes down to them from their betters. Petrarch,
with Latin so at his heart, could never confuse poetry and
prose. Dante’s definition<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c012'><sup>[89]</sup></a> is cold comfort for the heretic
about a rhythmic test. Of the smaller fry, Ronsard certainly
cleaves to this test of rhythm in poetry.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c012'><sup>[90]</sup></a> Gascoigne,
as the title of his little treatise shows, assumes with his teacher
Ronsard that verse is the condition if not the essence of the
art; and Puttenham, Webbe, Campion, Daniel, Harvey, even
Spenser,<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c012'><sup>[91]</sup></a> lean the same way. Sidney, it was shown above,
is no real opponent. Bacon himself, quoted so often to sustain
the cause of poetry in prose, should be read more carefully;<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c012'><sup>[92]</sup></a>
he really tosses to the winds all question of form, and
turns to poetry as “one of the principal portions of learning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So the great age thought of poetry; and so the balance
inclines as one comes nearer to our own days. Isaac
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Vossius, in a curious work<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a> published without his name,
holds to his father’s view of the case. Shaftesbury<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a> is peremptory
for “metred prose,” but, as both a lord and a wit,
disdains to give his reasons; while another person of quality,
Sir William Temple<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a> indeed, regards metred prose as a
monstrosity. Trapp, in his Oxford lectures,<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a> is squarely
for the rhythmic test, and will hold it in the teeth of all
Aristotelians; so will another professor of poetry, Polycarp
Leyser,<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c012'><sup>[97]</sup></a> of Helmstadt, a rationalist in his day, who thinks
it high time to have a modern system of poetics not drawn
altogether from the ancients.</p>

<p class='c013'>Across the channel, meanwhile, relations of poetry and
prose had been discussed, now as an eddy in the maelstrom
of argument about ancients or moderns, now as a question
for itself. The <i>Télémaque</i> of Fénelon was defended as a
great poem in prose; to the objection that it was not written
in verse, came answers in abundance. One of them, for
example, calls upon the ancients;<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a> Aristotle, Dionysius,
Strabo, said that verse is not essential to epic poetry. “One
may write it in prose, as one writes tragedies without rime.”
And the old saw—“one can make verses without poetry,
and be quite poetic without making verse”—is followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>by a definition of the whole matter; what constitutes a
poem is “the lively plot, the bold figures, the beauty and
variety of the images; it is the fire, the enthusiasm, the
impetuosity, the force, a <i>je ne sais quoi</i> in the words and in
the thoughts which only nature can give.” So run a dozen
other elaborate pleas for prose in poetry; but the arguments
usually end in contradiction, and nothing is brought forward
that really sets aside the feeling long ago expressed by Tom
Dekker<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c012'><sup>[99]</sup></a> in his sputtering, pamphleteer style, that “poetrie,
like honestie and olde souldiers, goes upon lame feete unlesse
there be musicke in her,” and that both poets and musicians
are children of Phœbus: “the one creates the ditty and gives
it the life or number, the other lends it voyce and makes it
speake musicke.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even those great changes which the second half of the
eighteenth century brought about in the making and in the
judging of poetry, left this matter of prose and verse in its
old estate. Whenever the critic has a writer to set up, a
writer to pull down, this test of verse will be thrust aside;
and it is no surprise to find men who belong to the same
literary creed—say Warton and Lowth—failing to see eye
to eye in this one article of faith. Joseph Warton,<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c012'><sup>[100]</sup></a> in his
guarded attack upon Pope, is working slowly to the inference
that it is not genius, but a vast talent, shiftiness of phrase
and smoothness of verse, that must explain Pope’s overwhelming
success. Hence Warton, in a reaction from this polished
and accurate rhythm,<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c012'><sup>[101]</sup></a> is sure that real poetry does not depend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>on verse. The sublime and the pathetic “are the two chief
nerves of genuine poetry.” Lowth,<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c012'><sup>[102]</sup></a> on the other hand,
though quite in line with the new critical movement, setting
about his great work, and undertaking to make his audience
feel and know the Hebrew scriptures to be poetry, puts metrical
questions in the forefront of his study and will prove that
these poems are in verse. He would fain shun this path,
thorny as it is and full of snares; but it is a necessary part of
his journey, for he is sure that poetry is not to be considered
apart from metrical form, and it ceases to be poetry when it
is reduced to prose.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c012'><sup>[103]</sup></a> Here Lowth and Warton clash not
only on the main point, but on this subsidiary matter of translation.
Warton said that by no “process of critical chymistry,”
such as dropping the measure and transposing the
words, can one disguise the <i>Iliad</i>, say, or the <i>Paradise Lost</i>,
and “reduce them to the tameness of prose.” Reduced to
prose, says Lowth, poetry does cease to be poetry. It is
strange to see how both sides of the controversy in this matter
of verse and prose appeal to translation, and it is mournful
to note the unstable character of what ought to be firm
and fundamental facts. A. W. Schlegel, one remembers, stood
for translations in verse. So Whately, following Lowth’s opinion,
appeals to translation for proof that to break the verse is
to shatter the poem;<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c012'><sup>[104]</sup></a> Racine,<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c012'><sup>[105]</sup></a> on the other hand, appealed to
a translation of Isaiah to fortify exactly the opposite opinion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Or will it be said that Goethe has settled this question in
favour of Warton’s view? Every critic knows the oracle from
Weimar which declared the best part of a poem to be whatever
remains when it is translated into prose; every critic,
however, is not at pains to quote the entire passage, with
its important concession to verse and its reason for the statement
as a whole. “I honour,” says Goethe,<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c012'><sup>[106]</sup></a> “rhythm as
well as rime, <i>by which poetry really comes to be poetry</i>;<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c012'><sup>[107]</sup></a> but
the thorough and permanent effect, what develops one and
helps one on one’s way, is that which is left of the poet when
he is translated into prose. Here is nothing but the contents
pure and simple,—otherwise often concealed, or, if
absent, replaced by a fine exterior form. <i>For this reason I
think prose translations better than poetical in the early stages
of education.</i>” He goes on to recommend a prose version of
Homer, to praise Luther’s Bible; but it is clear that the
whole extract is no argument against the test of rhythm.
Not to insist on Goethe’s concession that it is rhythm which
makes poetry to be poetry, one may note how little prose
translation does for a lyric, which, after all, is the poet’s
poem. What would be left in prose, any prose, of Goethe’s
own <i>Ueber allen Gipfeln ist Ruh’</i>? The heart of poetry is
another matter, its spirit, its informing life;<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c012'><sup>[108]</sup></a> the historian
meets it in terms of its bodily appearance, and must have a
concrete test. There is no valid test for the historian save
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>this test of rhythm. Particularly as sociological and historical
responsibility begins to weigh upon the critic, he finds that
such a test is demanded by his work. Adam Smith<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c012'><sup>[109]</sup></a>—Blair<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c012'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
is almost with him, but slips in a plea for Ossian—is
distinctly on the side of verse. So is Monboddo,<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c012'><sup>[111]</sup></a> a pioneer in
anthropology, keen, observant, who did his thinking for himself,
and condemned “all that has been written of late in the
rhapsody style, or measured prose,” declaring that “poetry
is nothing more than measured rhythm.” Sensible things,
too, were said on this matter by men who have left no traces
in criticism; one of these sayings seems to be a pretty conclusion
and summary of the whole debate. Dr. Thomas Barnes,
a Unitarian clergyman now forgotten, but one of the founders
of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester, an
interesting group of men, read, in December, 1781, a paper<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c012'><sup>[112]</sup></a>
“On the Nature and Essential Character of Poetry as Distinguished
from Prose.” He turns to origins, and refers to “the
common remark that the original language of mankind was
poetical”; he turns to ethnological hints, and, following Dr.
John Brown, speaks of “Indian orators at this day”; then,
summing up the case, he charges for rhythm. “To finished
and perfect poetry, or rather to the highest order of poetic
compositions, are necessary, elevation of sentiment, fire of
imagination, and regularity of metre. This is the summit of
Parnassus. But from this sublimest point there are gradual
declinations till you come to the reign of prose. <i>The last line
of separation is that of regular metre.</i>” Dr. Thomas Barnes
is forgotten; but his statement of the case is memorable above
a host of admired and often quoted deliverances on poetic art.</p>

<p class='c013'>As one steps into the modern world, one finds the controversy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>in its old estate, getting no help from new methods
and ridiculous enough, by this expense of motion without
progress, in contrast with the gain made by sciences of
every other sort. Does Coleridge,<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c012'><sup>[113]</sup></a> master of rhythm, reject
rhythm as a test, Poe<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c012'><sup>[114]</sup></a> comes forward to declare it an
essential condition, and to announce “the certainty that
music, in its various modes of metre, rhythm, and rime, is of
so vast a moment in poetry as never to be wisely rejected.”
Carlyle himself, reckoned by sundry critics as a poet in prose,
names the “vulgar” definition of verse only to approve it.
Germans, he says,<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c012'><sup>[115]</sup></a> have spoken of “infinitude” as differencing
true poetry from true speech not poetical; “if well
meditated, some meaning will gradually be found in it. For
my own part, I find considerable meaning in the old vulgar
distinction of poetry being metrical, having music in it, being
a song.” And he really adopts the test,—of course, with
characteristic riders. “Observe,” he says, “how all passionate
language does of itself become musical ... all
deep things are song.... Poetry, therefore, we will call
<i>musical thought</i>.” So, again, the vague and passionate protests
of Stuart Mill beat in vain against such a temperate
statement as Whately made in his <i>Rhetoric</i>.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c012'><sup>[116]</sup></a> “Any composition
in verse (and none that is not) is always called,
whether good or bad, a Poem, by all who have no favourite
hypothesis to maintain.... The title of Poetry does not
necessarily imply the requisite beauties of Poetry.” Such
a test, cried Mill,<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c012'><sup>[117]</sup></a> is vulgarest of all definitions, and “one
with which no person possessed of the faculties to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>poetry addresses itself can ever have been satisfied.” This
“wretched mockery of a definition” is more than inadequate;
for poetry may exist in prose as well as in verse, may even
do without words, and can speak through musical sounds,
through sculpture, painting, and architecture. It is strange
to hear Mill making a serious formula out of phrases to
which one is indulgent enough when they come in half
playful guise.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c012'><sup>[118]</sup></a> Apart from the uselessness of such a formula,—fancy
the historian of poetry opening a new chapter with
“We will now consider the Parthenon!”—it has no theoretical
value, as is easy to see when Mill begins to run his
division lines. Two definitions of poetry please him, one, by
Ebenezer Elliott, that it is “impassioned truth,” the other,
by a writer in <i>Blackwood</i>, that it is “man’s thought tinged
by his feelings.” But these “fail to distinguish poetry from
eloquence,” and Mill goes on to say that eloquence is “something
heard,” while poetry is “something overheard.” Something
overheard? I mean, he explains, that “all poetry is
in the nature of a soliloquy,” is “the natural fruit of solitude
and meditation.” Now this is sheer nonsense, although
more than one critic has hailed it as an oracle; of that
which comes down to us as poetry, a good part is anything
but soliloquy or the fruit of solitude. “Read Homer,” cried
out Herder, perhaps at the other extreme, but certainly with
better reason than Mill, “as if he were singing in the
streets!” It will be shown how vast a proportion of poetry,
too, that belongs to the higher class, was made and sung
in throngs of men. Poetry is a social fact. Mill’s own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>words defeat him. “Whosoever writes out truly any human
feeling, writes poetry”; and “what is poetry but the
thoughts and words <i>in which emotion spontaneously embodies
itself</i>?” A few pages before, it was “the fruit of solitude
and meditation,” a test that would make poetry of Kant’s
categorical imperative, refusing the title to Luther’s outburst
at the diet, although this at once becomes poetry
if one accepts the later definition in terms of emotional
spontaneity. And that wrath at the “vulgarity” of a
rhythmic test is nothing more than the old mistake;
because, forsooth, colours and lines fail to account in themselves
for the grandeur of painting, one jumps to the
assertion that paintings need not have colours and lines.
Let us cling to vulgarity, if leaving it means to assert that
the Parthenon is a poem, and, by implication, that a sigh
is a statue.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most consistent expositions of poetry is that
given by Hegel.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c012'><sup>[119]</sup></a> Here is a careful abstract of propositions
as carefully formulated and proved. He has ruled out the
“poetic sentence.” Specimens of the sublime, like that <i>Let
there be light, and there was light</i> which Longinus<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c012'><sup>[120]</sup></a> admired,
are not poetry. History, too, is excluded, Herodotus, Tacitus,
and the rest,<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c012'><sup>[121]</sup></a> as well as eloquence, and not as Shelley rejects
Cicero, on personal grounds, but because of the law in the
case. Yet this summary is still inadequate as a practical test,
and with it the historian is in a plight no better than when
with Sidney or Coleridge he was including whatever piece of
writing seemed certainly though indefinitely poetic. In the
latter case he steered by a compass which was at the mercy
of unnumbered hidden magnets; in the former case the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>signs on the card are blurred.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c012'><sup>[122]</sup></a> But Hegel does not leave
the matter here; purposely or not, he gives a clear test for
the historian when, twenty pages later, he comes to speak of
versification. Professors Gayley and Scott<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c012'><sup>[123]</sup></a> point out that
the present writer has made too much of this concession;
instead of saying that verse is “the only condition absolutely
demanded by poetry,” one should say that Hegel makes
verse indispensable. But this is quite enough for the purpose.
The passage in question runs thus: “To be sure,
prose put into verse is not poetry, but simply verse, just as
mere poetic expression in what is otherwise prosaic treatment
results only in a poetic prose; <i>but nevertheless, metre
or rime, being the one and only sensuous aroma,<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c012'><sup>[124]</sup></a> is absolutely
demanded for poetry, and indeed is even more necessary than
store of imagery, the so-called beautiful diction</i>.” And now
for Hegel’s reason, which quite agrees with the historian’s
demand for an available test. He goes on to say that the
fact of verse in any piece of literature shows at once, as
poetry indeed demands there should be shown, that one is in
another realm from the realm of prose, of daily life; this
constraint, if one likes to call it constraint, forces the poet
outside the bounds of common speech into a province wholly
submitted to the laws of art. That poetry has to be something
more than this, that there are other canons, nobody
denies; but the first step for a poet is into this realm of
verse where he must prove in sterner tests and by other
achievements whether he is citizen or trespasser.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Hegel, it might be said, is in the clouds; he is out of
touch with science, and with that logic of facts which rules
investigations of the present day. But the same way of
thinking holds with a practical Englishman like Mr. Edmund
Gurney,<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c012'><sup>[125]</sup></a> whose feet are planted very firmly on solid ground,
who is distinctly hostile to the poem in prose, that “pestilent
heresy,” as Professor Saintsbury has called it, and whose
idea of art, which always includes an appeal to the sense of
form, demands in poetry a definite metre or rhythm. And
the same way of thinking holds with a student of modern
psychology, M. Souriau,<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c012'><sup>[126]</sup></a> who undertakes to define poetry in
terms of science. Poetry itself derives from music and
prose,—presumably he means by prose the speech of daily
life, and not what Walter Pater means in his essay on Style
when he makes “music and prose literature ... the opposite
terms of art”; poetry might therefore be called musical
speech.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c012'><sup>[127]</sup></a> To show how much depends on the music, M. Souriau
turns to translations from foreign poetry into prose vernacular.
“The more poetical this original text, the more it
loses in the change.... This depreciation is due to the
change of process, and not to the change of tongue, for the
translation of a piece of prose would not show these faults.”
On the other hand, now, take an irreproachable piece of
verse, with this superiority just shown to be due to its
rhythm, and look at it with regard to logical worth. How
unsatisfying, how “thin,” is the thought in it! Change
again the point of view, and study poetry for its music;
one will be no better pleased than when one hunted for its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>thought. The rhythm would be intolerably monotonous in a
piece of music. The sonorous words, taken as sound, are
not really pleasing to the ear. Rime, if one will look at it
this way, is a <i>procédé enfantin</i>. In sum, poetry is logically
inferior to prose, and musically inferior to pure melody,—and
what, then, is its own charm? It pleases us, not by
either one of these elements, but by their combination; it is
harmony, but in a peculiar sense. “It is not the harmony of
thought, logical system, and order, not the harmony of sounds
or musical system, but the harmony between sounds and
thoughts. <i>One loves to feel the idea bending and adjusting
itself to the rules of verse, and the verse yielding to the demands
of the idea.</i>”<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c012'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>It is time to close the poll. For poetry in prose no one
has spoken in such a temperate and yet forcible fashion as
Mr. Frederic Harrison,<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c012'><sup>[129]</sup></a> though his arguments are by no
means new. Nothing but “poetry,” he asserts, can serve as
the word to express what one finds in Malory’s <i>Death of
Arthur</i>, in chapters of Job and Isaiah. But arguments such
as he makes with energy and eloquence lose their force when
confronted with the cool reasoning of Mr. Bosanquet,<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c012'><sup>[130]</sup></a> who
shows clearly that poetry, whatever else it may be, must be
rhythmic utterance. Even in the clash of opinion between
these modern writers, one finds what is to be found throughout
the entire controversy, down from the days of the early
renaissance, that the advocates of a rhythmic test for poetry
have the better of the argument. It has been shown that
there is no other test for the historian of poetry as a social
institution; and whenever another test has been set up,
its own advocates have not only abandoned it in practice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>but even in theory have obscured it with a mass of contradictions.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c012'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>There remains, of course, the <i>ambulando</i> argument; the
champion of poetry in prose points to the work which passes
under this name. A book could be written on the long series
of concessions in matter of territory which verse has made to
prose; but no sensible critic will allow these transfers to
prove that poetry has ceased to be rhythmic utterance. The
most obvious transfer, of course, is translation; is not the
English Bible as noble poetry, one asks, as can be found in
any time or clime? Mr. Theodore Watts<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c012'><sup>[132]</sup></a> is sure of the
rhythmic test until he faces the claims of this noblest prose.
Yet surely what appeals to us here is not poetry, but the
genius of the English tongue at its greatest and best,<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c012'><sup>[133]</sup></a> flinging
its full strength upon a task which at the time lay close
to the heart of the English people. The Bible is not the
masterpiece of our poetry, but of our prose; it beats not
only with the divine pulse of its original, but also with that
immense vitality and energy of English religious life in days
when to many Englishmen life and religion were identical.
That does not make it poetry. One must not open the
gates of poetry to this or that passage of prose, and shut
them, through whim or shame, upon a thousand other passages.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c012'><sup>[134]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Let in that great chapter of Job, and anon <i>Werther</i>
is there, <i>Silas Marner</i>, <i>Tom Jones</i>,—we have marshalled this
rout already. No, if the Bible be poetry, it is because it is
rhythmic utterance, not because it is sublime. That tremendous
reach of emotion borne on the cadence of a style majestic
and clear, the voice of a solitary desolation crying to the
desolation of all mankind, the wail of an eternal and unanswered
question—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,</div>
      <div class='line'>And life unto the bitter in soul?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>—is not this a poem? It is almost certainly a poem in the
original; it might be a poem in English, provided the rhythm
of the lines, printed as they now are, with parallelism and
cadence properly brought out, seemed to the reader to have
a recurrent regularity which could take it into the sphere
of rhythmic law; otherwise it is prose, the prose of great
literature, indeed, but prose. It must be granted, too,
that the latter view is preferable. As great literature, the
book of Job belongs with Dante, and Milton, and with a few
passages, where Goethe touches the higher levels, in <i>Faust</i>;
but it is not poetry in the sense that Dante and Milton and
Goethe impress upon one when one reads their great passages.
Longinus writes on the sublime in literature, and he is within
his rights when he puts Thucydides and Homer and Moses
upon one plane; but it is the plane of sublimity in thought
and phrase, and it is not the plane of poetry. Poetry has no
monopoly of the emotions; a line that stirs the heart is poetry
when it belongs in a rhythmic whole, and is prose when it
does not. <i>Tendentesque manus ripae ulterioris amore</i> is
Vergil’s verse; “the future balances and the hieroglyphic
meanings of human suffering” is De Quincey’s prose.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Carlyle says of his murdered Princess de Lamballe, “She
was beautiful; she was good; she had known no happiness,”—anvil-strokes
as strong as the strongest in English speech.
Webster, over his murdered Duchess of Malfi, makes the
brother cry out, “Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle; she
died young.” What have phrases like “poetic prose” to do
with great literature of this sort, and how will one distinguish
between these two isolated passages, both throbbing with an
intensity of expression which breaks out in the three short
clauses? Well, the rhythm of one comes to its rights in the
full poetic period where Webster, rough as his verses are,
infused a noble harmony; while the cadence of the other
falls naturally into the sweep of Carlyle’s prose. Dryden,
indeed, with his wonted critical felicity, gives the key of the
whole matter. “Thoughts,” he says in his preface to the
<i>Fables</i>, “thoughts come crowding in so fast upon me, that my
only difficulty is to choose or to reject, to run them into verse,
<i>or to give them the other harmony of prose</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Since Turgot<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c012'><sup>[135]</sup></a> told France and the world that a new kind
of poetry had come in the guise of Gessner’s prose idylls
the poem in prose has made many claims for Parnassian recognition.
At Bertrand we have glanced already; his scholar
Baudelaire<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c012'><sup>[136]</sup></a> made as bold essay; and so, in quite recent times,
the Swede Ola Hansson;<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c012'><sup>[137]</sup></a> all these are Werther with a difference,
and in the last case with a dash of Nietzsche. He,
too, wrote a dithyrambic prose for his hysterical but noteworthy
Zarathustra; yet who does not feel the passage, as into
another realm of art, when one suddenly comes upon that
powerful lyric in verse,<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c012'><sup>[138]</sup></a> <i>O Mensch, gieb Acht?</i> Nietzsche,
to be sure, had something to say; but with the little men these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>dithyrambic phrases threaten to turn into mere raving, and
often carry out the threat. What saves a poet from this danger,
and the great poets know it, is the dignity, the self-restraint,
and the communal human sympathy of rhythm, which binds
one, as in that old consent of voice and step, to one’s fellows, and
checks all individual centrifugal follies; there are no bounds,
no laws, there is no decorum, in such whirling words, until
they whirl in ordered motion and until cosmos is where chaos
was. “Slaves by their own compulsion,” these sensual and
dark things rebel in vain against the laws of poetic form; pastels
and whatever else, they have not even the dignity of
truly great prose. They are out of their sphere; to adapt a
line from the <i>Dunciad</i>, prose on stilts is several degrees worse
than poetry fallen lame.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poetry, then, is still rhythmic utterance, though it has lost
great stretches of territory to prose. Prose, to be sure, makes
a tempting proposition to her impoverished friend. “Let us
call ourselves by one name,” she says, “unite all our power,
and so make front against science.” Such a union has long
appealed to the French. Fénelon, one knows, sought thus
to revive the epic; and many pens were set scratching for or
against the <i>Télémacomanie</i>. Chateaubriand<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c012'><sup>[139]</sup></a> tried a cadenced
prose in his <i>Martyrs</i>, by way of putting new life into sacred
poetry. Flaubert<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c012'><sup>[140]</sup></a> and sundry of his school, above all, the
Italian D’Annunzio, annex poetry to the prose romance, and
not poetry as an informing spirit simply, but the cadences,
the colour, the very refrain.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c012'><sup>[141]</sup></a> Maeterlinck uses the poetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>device of repetition—say in the <i>Princesse Maleine</i>—to the
verge of regular rhythm. Rime itself is not excluded; witness
this from D’Annunzio’s novel:<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c012'><sup>[142]</sup></a> “rideva, gemeva, pregava,
cantava, accarezzava, singhiozzava, miniaciava; ilare,
flebile, umile, ironica, lusinghevole, disperata, crudele.”<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c012'><sup>[143]</sup></a> Is
poetry, then, fallen by the wayside, and has prose spoiled her
of her raiment, so as to stand hereafter in her stead? No.
Whatever Walter Pater may have done for English or these
men for Italian and French, they have at best set up a new
euphemism<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c012'><sup>[144]</sup></a> of no real promise and permanence. When the
final balance is struck, these writers will perhaps take a place
in prose analogous, even if in a contrary spirit, to the place
of Swift in verse. Swift’s “unpoetic verse” is remorselessly
clear, remorselessly direct; one must read his poetry, and in
great measure admire, even like it, for its compelling energy
and lucidity of style. Yet, after all, one feels that these are
alien virtues, imported from the realm of prose; and one
reads Swift’s poems much as one listens to a foreigner conversing
correctly, admirably, in one’s own tongue. And as
with Swift’s prose excellence in poetry, so with this poetic
excellence in prose; in the long account, <i>laudatur et alget</i>.
It makes the vain attempt to move landmarks set up, not by
men, but by man, by human nature itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>So much for the theories; but it must now be proved beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>question that rhythm is the vital and essential quality
in the beginnings of poetic art. Where to draw the line between
prose and verse, between the recurrence which is regular
and which is called for our purposes rhythm, and the
recurrence that is not regular, is hard indeed; but perhaps a
satisfactory rule may be given in the words of Professor Budde,
a distinguished student of that Hebrew poetry to which so
many advocates of the prose poem have made appeal. “The
fundamental law of form in all poetry,” he says,<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c012'><sup>[145]</sup></a> “by which in
every race and at all times verse is distinguished from prose,
is that while in prose the unchecked current of speech flows
consistently as far as the thought carries it, the range of
thought and the length of the sentence changing often and
in many ways, verse, on the other hand, divides its store of
thought into relatively short lines which appeal to the ear
as distinct not only by this shortness, but also by relations
determined by laws definite, indeed, but varying with different
races and languages. Whenever the formal factors of
poetry are enriched, these smallest units, the verses or lines,
tend to join, by a new bond, in a higher unit of form.”<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c012'><sup>[146]</sup></a> This
formal factor may be now alliteration, now rime; with the
Hebrews, says Budde, it was the thought, which made a
higher unit of the short and separated units of line or verse.
Lowth’s <i>parallelismus membrorum</i>  does not quite cover
the rhythmical structure of Hebrew verse; no matter if a
fixed metre has not yet been found, the rhythm is evident,
and its law is essentially equal length of the verses within
the group.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c012'><sup>[147]</sup></a> For a test, one must fall back upon that original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>organ of poetry, the human voice. Slave to the eye, one
often reads as prose what one could read, or what could be
read to one, as poetry.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c012'><sup>[148]</sup></a> In any case, there will be debatable
ground, perhaps neutral ground; but it is safe to say from
theory, from the practical trial, from arguments of the learned,
that so far the effort to obliterate verse or rhythm as the real
boundary line of poetic territory, has proved a failure, and is
likely to prove a failure as often as it shall be tried. The case
must be taken to the court of human history and human progress;
brought hither, all the arguments for poems in prose
lose their power. If, as Bücher says, one is unwilling nowadays
to let rhythmic speech pass, merely in so far as it is rhythmic
speech, for poetry, that is because ages of culture, with increasing
æsthetic demands, have quite naturally added new
conditions; but the beginning of poetry as an æsthetic fact
was in the sense of rhythm. The poem now laboriously
wrought at the desk goes back to the rhythm of work or
play or dance in the life of primitive man, and the element
of rhythm is the one tie that binds beginning and end; if
poetry denies rhythm, it denies itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>This statement itself, however, certain of the learned now
vehemently oppose, and bring reasons for their attitude quite
different from such arguments as we have been considering
for the prose poem. Rhythm itself, they maintain, is
the outcome of prose. It is the child, says one bold
German, of grammatical inflections and the stress of oratory.
Here is fine revolution, indeed, if they have the trick to show
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>it. Strabo, in a classic sentence,<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c012'><sup>[149]</sup></a> laid down the law which
writer after writer has taken without question as undisputed
and indisputable authority; poetry came before prose.
“Flowery prose,” he said, “is nothing but an imitation of
poetry,” which is the “origin of all rhetorical language,”
and was at first always sung; “the very term <i>prose</i>,” he concludes,
“which is applied to language not clothed in metre,
seems to indicate ... its descent from an elevation, or
chariot, to the ground.” Hence the <i>sermo pedestris</i> of Latin
writers. Against this, now, come sundry scattered hints and
at least two elaborate arguments. Vigfusson and Powell,<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c012'><sup>[150]</sup></a>
after a consideration of old Scandinavian poetry, are fain to
think that Germanic rhythm was at the start simply “excited
and emphatic prose,” and make rhythm in general not an
essential so much as an accomplishment and aftergrowth of
poetry. Finding no metre in this same Norse poetry, none
in Hebrew, Gottsched,<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c012'><sup>[151]</sup></a> while he allowed that songs were the
earliest poetic form, thought them to have been simple
unmetrical chants, as if a child should sing the Lord’s
prayer. Many ballads, even English and Scottish, seem to
show with other supposed primitive traits a rough and faulty
structure of verse, so that certain critics, in their haste, make
the lack of smooth metres a test of age,—an idea which
long prevailed in regard to Chaucer’s versification. It is
said<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c012'><sup>[152]</sup></a> that until the beginning of the seventeenth century Hungarian
poetry was “quite without system, without rhythm,
full of bad rimes, and mainly made up of verses joined in
long, monotonous rows”; this, however, as in India, may have
been the case not with lyric, but only with epic. Comparetti
thinks that the <i>Kalevala</i> was founded upon earlier poetic or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>roughly rhythmic prose,—again a matter of epic; and earliest
Japanese poetry, so far as it has been preserved, “is not far
removed from prose.”<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c012'><sup>[153]</sup></a> Now and then, but not often, one is
told that savage songs have no regular rhythm and no settled
order in the verse. If it be true that mere counting of syllables
was the earliest form of common Aryan versification, it
is at first sight not so unreasonable to assume some sort of
excited prose as a common basis for this system as well as for
the systems of quantitative and of accentual rhythm. Moreover,
as will be shown in later pages, there is a feeling abroad
which runs counter to any notion of spontaneity, and insists
upon a process of invention and imitation; this, too, would
make against a natural rhythm,<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c012'><sup>[154]</sup></a> would throw out rhythm as
an essential and primitive part of poetry.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c012'><sup>[155]</sup></a> So much for scattered
hints and observations; there are more elaborate attacks.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a treatise by Norden<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c012'><sup>[156]</sup></a> on ancient artistic prose, one has
under one’s hand all the evidence which can be gathered
from the classics, particularly the Greek, for this view of the
relations between prose and verse; here, too, are ranged
certain arguments against that old notion of the precedence
of poetry.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c012'><sup>[157]</sup></a> Musical sense, rhythm, was given to man with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the spoken word itself, as in historical times to the Hellenic
folk, whose melodious sentence is as inaudible as the music
of the spheres to an ear dependent upon modern speech.
Now before poetry was developed, Norden assumes, there
was a rhythmic prose distinguished by some kind of
emphasis from the speech of daily life; thence sprang on
one hand the rhythm of regular poetry, and on the other
hand a rhythm of impassioned, oratorical prose. The oratory
of Greece was a kind of chanting, and the gestures that went
with it were a species of dance; but these in no way could
be called identical with the singing or recitation of poetry.
Then came confusion. Gorgias began a new era when he
imported certain elements of poetry into his prose; even the
rimed prose of the Middle Ages Norden<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c012'><sup>[158]</sup></a> calls “the result of
a thousand years of development from the time of Gorgias.”
The early results, however, were destructive. Tragedy,
thinks our author, was ruined in Hellas because all barriers
were broken down between poetry and prose, and rhetoric
overwhelmed the drama; great epos yielded to great history;
gnomic poetry vanished; epigram supplanted elegy; dithyramb
made room for lofty prose at large.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c012'><sup>[159]</sup></a> But this is
nothing more than a process in civilized Greece analogous to
the process in our own day described a few pages above.
Even the tradition of the classical writers pointed back to an
age of poetry which preceded prose; for while Strabo, in
the passage already considered, and Varro,<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c012'><sup>[160]</sup></a> speak of actual
literature which they had in hand, Plutarch, writing on the
Pythian oracle, made poetry the product of primitive times
and prose the outcome of prehistorical decadence. Against
this tradition, which he makes a mere glorification of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>golden age, Norden argues with learning and acuteness, and
from material furnished by Greek literature itself. But
Greek literature is surely no criterion for primitive song;
persistent as this prejudice is,<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c012'><sup>[161]</sup></a> Norden sees that ethnology
has better points of view, and in one or two places he calls
upon it for aid.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c012'><sup>[162]</sup></a> The distinction between poetry and prose
is, for him, “secondary, not essential,” for the reason that
he cannot find this distinction in the earliest expression of
formal or solemn language known to the various races of
man, whether on highest or lowest planes of culture. His
summary may be quoted, temperate and reasonable as it
is; it appeals to ethnological arguments, which would be
close upon convincement if they did not utterly neglect, as
nearly all writers on poetry have neglected, the communal
basis of the art, and the fundamental consideration that
earliest poetry is more a social than an individual expression.
Norden’s eye is fixed upon the priest, the poet, the medicine
man, the lawgiver; he forgets the throng, and he forgets that
the throng was mainly active and rarely passive in the primitive
stages of poetry. But let his own summary be heard.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c012'><sup>[163]</sup></a>
The line now drawn between poetry and prose, he maintains,
was unknown to primitive races. Forms of magic, the language
of the laws, ceremonial religious rites, were everywhere
made in prose; not, however, in the prose of daily
conversation, but in a prose removed from common conditions
by two factors: first, it was spoken in measured, solemn
tones, and so became rhythmical,—not the regular rhythm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>of song, but a sort of chant or recitation,<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c012'><sup>[164]</sup></a> so that one may
figure the early priest like his modern brother, the snowy-banded,
delicate-handed one, at his intoning; and, secondly,
it was furnished, for emphasis and for the help of memory,
with certain vocal expedients, such as alliteration and rime,
which are inborn alike in the most civilized and in the wildest
races. This kind of prose existed before there was any
artistic poetry. Norden would like to see more work done
in the field of early legal and religious forms; old Latin
prayers, old Germanic laws, for example, have been coaxed
or bullied into some metrical scheme, and made to pass as
poetry. Elsewhere he takes the case of that prayer to
Mars which Westphal and Allen called Saturnian verse; by
Norden’s reckoning, this is mainly alliterative, rhythmic
prose; only the second half can be called metrical; and he
is convinced that Saturnian verse itself is nothing but the
later metrical equipment of what was once rhythmic prose
solemnly spoken with two sections to the line. <i>Carmen</i>, he
goes on to say, is originally any solemn formula whether
spoken or sung, whether rhythmic prose, even simple prose,
or verse;<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c012'><sup>[165]</sup></a> that is “settled.” It is a clever suggestion, too,
that rhythmic prose belongs with what one now calls the
loose sentence, while artistic prose, contemporary with
artistic and metrical poetry, came into prominence with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>periodic structure;<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c012'><sup>[166]</sup></a> so the tale, like Grimm’s familiar “There
was once a king’s son, and he was very beautiful ...,” in
its uninvolved, consecutive phrases, would give one an idea
of the early rhythmic prose.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this is useful and suggestive; but it by no means does
away with the fact of regular rhythmic utterance for primitive
times. Who, for example, is going to believe that rime
and alliteration were developed before regular rhythm,—regular
rhythm, as will presently be shown, standing out
as the one fact about savage poetry to which nearly all
evidence of ethnology gives assent? Who will deny that
quite as early as any priest recited his prayer or buzzed
his magic in solemn prose, there was a throng of folk
dancing and singing with a rhythm as exact as may be?
Did the priests, even, recite in “irregular rhythmic prose”
that repeated <i>enos Lases juvate</i> of the Arval rites, sung
as they beat the ground in concerted measure of the
dance? “So long,” says Usener<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c012'><sup>[167]</sup></a> in his book on old Greek
verse, “so long as human societies turned in solemn and
festal manner to the divinities, so long they made petition,
thanks, laud, in measured and rhythmic verse, and the words
were inseparable from singing and the steps of the march.”
For purposes of this kind, and such purposes are the very
soul of primitive social life, chanted prose is out of the question.
An excellent authority in musical matters, Dr. Jacobsthal,<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c012'><sup>[168]</sup></a>
points out that the rhythm, if one may so call it, of
the chant stands to real rhythm as prose stands to verse, and
that the song to which a throng must dance, as in primitive
times, <i>can “in no case” lack the regular rhythm</i>. Who,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>moreover, that has read Bücher’s essay can overlook the
fact that primitive labour must have begotten an exact
rhythm, and very early must have given meaning to this
rhythm by more or less connected words? The proof, offered
not only by Norden but in those scattered hints already
noted, breaks down when confronted with hard facts. Ballad
metres are often rough in the copies which have come down
to us, but a hundred considerations show this to have been
the fault of the copy itself, not of the makers and singers,<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c012'><sup>[169]</sup></a>
and to have been due to the transfer from oral to written
conditions. There seems to be no reason why a letter should
not be quoted which the late Professor Child wrote in 1885
to the author of the present book; “any <i>volkslied</i>,” he said,
“shows as good an ear as any Pindaric ode by Gray or
whomever else.” It is the sense of complicated metres
which is due to culture and intellectual development, and
not the sense of exact and simple rhythm. As regards that
protoplasmic prose of the popular tale, which Norden calls
“the essential test of primitive speech,” how can he prove
that it is the essential test of primitive song? How different
Bruchmann, who admits early prose narrative, but says distinctly
that early poetry, lyric outpouring of emotion, was
song; “the earliest of all poetry” for him is communal song,
<i>gesang in gemeinschaft</i>, golden words indeed! Grosse is to
the same effect. Who denies the tale, the loose prose style
in short sentences verging on rhythmic effects? Of course
the entertainer told his tale betimes; but earlier than this
tale, the dance of the throng, as well as the labour of daily
life, had from the very beginning mated sounds and words
with rhythm, precise rhythm, as a festal and consenting act.
A mass of evidence, soon to be considered, is overwhelmingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>for this state of things. Norden appeals for the form
of the tale to Radloff, a great authority; let us do the same
for the form of the song. In an article on poetic forms
among the Altaic Tartars,<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c012'><sup>[170]</sup></a> Radloff remarks that in these
isolated tribes popular literature, without even the faintest
influence from the lettered world, has been developed in a
quite natural way. Especially worthy of note, he says, is
the strictness of metrical form in their poetry. He notes,
moreover, the inseparable character, under such conditions,
of poetry and song. The specimens which he gives are
anything but rhythmic prose, and the rhythmic law is anything
but loose. The tales on the other hand are quite
different; “these are not sung,” he says, “but recited,”
although now and then the reciter sings a verse or so.
Which came first, the entertainer and his audience, or the
festal, singing throng? Evidence of ethnology and conclusions
of sociology certainly put the singing, dancing throng as a
primary social fact, and the relation of audience to entertainer
as a secondary social fact. Mr. Joseph Jacobs<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c012'><sup>[171]</sup></a> has hailed
the <i>cante-fable</i> as protoplasm alike of the metrical ballad
and of the prose tale, one omitting prose, the other omitting
verse; and while this does not really help Norden’s claim,
it is worth the while to note how it assumes a development
which is counter to all the facts. Even on its chosen ground
of Celtic tales, this theory meets indications that the verse
is original and the prose of later date.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c012'><sup>[172]</sup></a> The <i>cante-fable</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>seems like a late form, a device of the entertainer; the
scraps of verse are survivals, just as the chorus in a Greek
drama is the survival of a drama in which all took part, with
no division into actors and spectators. In the Chinese
drama<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c012'><sup>[173]</sup></a> an Occidental ear is offended by a remarkable confusion
of speaking and singing; even a single sentence in
the dialogue is so divided that part is spoken and part is
sung. This is no primitive and protoplasmic state; it is
rather the confusion of contraries, than the germ of related
and naturally developed forms of art. Poetry and prose in
historic times have been approaching each other, not diverging,
and the curve of evolution would indicate a wide distinction
at the start. Mixture of prose, as Professor Sievers
sees it, is a sign of decay in the <i>Muspilli</i>, in the Hildebrand
Lay.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c012'><sup>[174]</sup></a> On the other hand, in vigorous poetry like the Roumanian
ballad there is no mixture of prose, while the
Roumanian popular tale is sprinkled with verses; yet here
is precisely where the protoplasmic state ought to be found
for both arts, since the poetical style is “simple as possible,”
has often no relative clauses for whole pages, and
is full of repetition.<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c012'><sup>[175]</sup></a> Under simple conditions, poetry
often breaks up into prose, but prose is not found in
its transition to poetry; for proof it is enough to quote a
recent writer on German ballads.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c012'><sup>[176]</sup></a> “More and more,” he
says, “the ballads disintegrate into prose, a process which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>has been noted for Spain, Sweden, Scotland, Portugal, and
is also known in Germany.”<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c012'><sup>[177]</sup></a> He gives quotations and
references to support his assertion, going on to name several
well-known ballads which began as such and then, in the
guise of prose tales, won as wide and as great a vogue as
the originals had enjoyed before. Perhaps in the case of
poetic composition at a time when intellect has mastered
emotion, prose may be the basis of poetry, but this case has
no bearing on primitive conditions. Whether a poet nowadays
conceives his work in prose, as Goethe did in the
<i>Iphigenie</i>, or begins with the “brains beat into rhythm,” is
an individual matter. “When Gautier wished to do a good
piece of work, he always began in verse,” say the Goncourts.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c012'><sup>[178]</sup></a>
Tradition makes Vergil write out his <i>Æneid</i> in prose and
then turn it into verse; Vida<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c012'><sup>[179]</sup></a> commends this method for the
prentice in poetry. There is a curious passage in Goethe’s
letter to Schiller of 5 March, 1798, about renewed work on
<i>Faust</i>. “Some tragic scenes were done in prose; by reason
of their naturalness and strength they are quite intolerable
in relation to the other scenes. I am, therefore, now trying
to put them into rime, for there the idea is seen as if under
a veil, and the immediate effect of this tremendous material
is softened.” This, however, has nothing to do with primitive
conditions of poetry; the simplicity of modern prose is an
effort of art, and belongs with the intellectual empire, while
rhythm, particularly in its early form of repetition, is the
immediate and spontaneous expression of emotion, and likely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>to be more pronounced and dominant the nearer one is to
the primitive state of things.</p>

<p class='c013'>What Norden really does is to scour away accretions of
silliness, romantic and sentimental phrases, which are too
often held as part and parcel of a sensible belief about poetry
in its early stage. Granted, as it is to be hoped the reader
will ultimately grant, that singing and dancing wax in importance
as one traces back the path of the arts, granted
that verse and song covered a far greater field of activity
in the beginning than they cover now, the notion that men
with language in a fluent state, and on intellectual topics,
sang instead of talking, that primitive life was like an Italian
opera-stage, that the better part of man’s utterance was
given over to lyrical wonder at the sunset and the stars,—these
ideas, even when hallowed by great names, must be
tossed to oblivion. But such a jettison by no means involves
the sinking of the ship itself; to change the figure, gentlemen
who have overthrown a minor idol or so must not loudly
proclaim that they have razed the temple and rooted out the
faith. For example, Grimm of old and Kögel of late<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c012'><sup>[180]</sup></a> were
too fond of poetic laws; the former confounded quaintness
with beauty, and the latter discovered too much rhythm. The
Frisian code, Kögel seems to have thought, was composed
and recited as poetry, as alliterative verse. Well, this is
perhaps Frisiomania of a dangerous kind, and Dr. Siebs<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c012'><sup>[181]</sup></a> is
within his rights in preaching another sermon on the old
but dubious text of <i>Frisia non cantat</i>. The laws, he says,
were indeed alliterative; but they were neither rhythmic
nor poetical. So far, so good; the advantage seems to be
on the side of Siebs; the idol totters and possibly falls.
But now to pull down the temple! Whence came this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>alliteration? Like rime, it is a product of prose, declares
the iconoclast, “having, in the first place, nothing to do with
poetry,” and probably rising in answer to a demand of the
language of trade, which needed to lay stress on the emphatic
parts of one’s plea for a good bargain. That is, the
mainstay of all Germanic rhythm is a “drummer’s” device,
and begins in the shifty phrases of the early Germanic <i>hausierer</i>.
This is a world of broken hopes. Norden for rime,<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c012'><sup>[182]</sup></a> and
Siebs for alliteration, which is only rime of another sort,
have entered a terrific <i>caveat</i> against the historian of primitive
song. Is rime, then, the fine flower and outgrowth of
a stump-speech, and is alliteration, poor changeling, unmasked
in these latter days as an intruder and an alien in poetic halls, a
by-blow of the primitive bagman? No, the temple is not pulled
down. The rhythmical or unrhythmical character of Frisian
laws is one thing; the origin of rime, the functions and progress
of it, cannot be even guessed on the basis of such studies.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two attempts, however, to prove the priority of prose, not
by the classics, not by folklore alone, not by alliterative
laws, but by ethnological facts and by comparative methods,
may now be considered. Poetry as a whole, says Professor
Biedermann,<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c012'><sup>[183]</sup></a> and regarded in the genetic way, was not
originally bound up with song, not even with rhythm. Song,
he says, does not make poetry, but breaks it, disturbs and
corrupts it. Maori and Malay, he points out, simply recite
their legends and poems; in the old Persian, as in the old
Japanese poetry, there is no rhythm to be found; and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>assures his reader “that attempts to prove the original unity
of poetry, music, and rhythm have come to wrack,”—a
statement which needs great store of assurance when one
considers it after reading the book under review. Biedermann’s
own theory is offered in a nutshell. Poetry began
as mere repetition, without music or rhythm, a parlous and
naked state indeed; the taste for music is simply a chastened
love of noise;<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c012'><sup>[184]</sup></a> while rhythm is the result of concerted labour.
That in after ages the three wanderers now and then met and
passed the time of day, Biedermann is generous enough not
to deny.</p>

<p class='c013'>More weighty objections are to be found in an article by
R. de la Grasserie.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c012'><sup>[185]</sup></a> Spoken words, he says, fall into prose
as expression of thought, and into poetry as expression of
sentiment; prose is fundamental, while poetry gets its
material from prose, and follows it in point of time, although
it is conceded that the full development of poetry precedes
the full development of prose. At first it would seem that
the author regarded verse as essential to poetry; the poet
and the verse-maker, he says, must be united as a single
productive power. But at once he goes on to ask whether
verse be the sole poetic expression, and answers in the negative.
Poetry is creation, “subjective discovery” of any sort,
as opposed to the objective discoveries of science, where
nothing is created. Didactic, mnemonic verse is not poetry,
for it is merely the verse that is mnemonic; and the reason
why poetry has come to be confounded with versification is
simply that verse was needed for the recording or memorizing
of poetry.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c012'><sup>[186]</sup></a> This teleological explanation of rhythm is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>very weak joint in De la Grasserie’s armour; it shows how
easily common sense can make itself ridiculous in its excess,
a tendency commonly ascribed to sentimental and enthusiastic
ideas alone. Facing the splendours of rhythm, knowing
how it has held itself abreast of the lordliest doings of poetry,
one laughs at the notion that its only credentials on Olympus
should be its mnemonic convenience; and De la Grasserie
thrusts his explanation handily away among the mists of
primitive song. Then he turns to his theory of poetic growth.
Poetry passed through three stages of expression,—first,
prose; next, rhythmic prose; last, verse. How did poetry
begin in prose? Well, it was “prose à courte haleine,”<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c012'><sup>[187]</sup></a> prose
with thought-pauses as frequent as rhythmic pauses, so
that there was no distinction between prose and verse,—and
no good reason, the reader is tempted to add, why this
same prose should not be called verse outright. Exactly
what thought-pauses have to do with a period when poetry
consisted in the indefinite repetition of a very short phrase
or even of a single word, and when, by all evidence, the
pause is rhythmic entirely, the author does not say; he is
dealing with a theory and not with facts, and so he assumes
a majestic periodic prose as primitive utterance. Next after
“prose” came “rhythmic prose,” and then verse; but the
evolutionary process goes on, and from verse, as in these
latter days, one turns back to prose in rhythm, and yet again
to prose outright. If one asks for a bill of particulars, if
one asks how verse came out of rhythmic prose, one is told
that two propositions may have had the same number of
words, just as in Arabic, just as in the <i>Avesta</i>,<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c012'><sup>[188]</sup></a>—that the
“two propositions” were once mere repetition, and sung
in perfect time is, of course, not noted,—so that the psychic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>pause grows to be one with the rhythmic pause. But,
accepting the impossible terms of the case, what proof is
offered that word-counting and syllable-counting are of higher
date than actual rhythm? Granting this, to be sure, the
next step is easy; interior symmetry now comes into play,
the measure of feet, the perfect rhythm of Greek and Latin
verse. What cause, then, was at work thus to develop
verse out of prose? Music and singing, answers the ingenious
essayist; but the ingenious essayist has calmly shut
out all facts save such as suit his case, and one is curious to
know what he would do with ethnological evidence in regard
to the priority and primacy of dance and song. Did man
come to this fine mastery of metres and this subtle sense of
quantities before he had begun to dance to his own singing?</p>

<p class='c013'>If M. de la Grasserie were right, if Professor Norden were
right, in this plea for prose as the parent of verse, a work on
the beginnings of poetry could have nothing to do with verse,
and only a little to do with rhythmic prose. Barring the way
to their conclusions stand two facts. Rhythm is the prime
characteristic, the essential condition, of the dance, and oldest
poetry is by common consent found in close alliance with
dance and song. Secondly, as the brilliant essay of Bücher
has made more than probable, backed as it is by evidence of
a really primitive character, and not by theories based upon
a highly developed literature, poetry in some of its oldest
forms, older indeed than that supposed period of earliest
prose which M. de la Grasserie assumes for the start, was not
only the companion but the offspring of labour. In postponing
rhythmic utterance to the third great period of the development
of poetry, the champion of prose origins is running
counter to tradition, counter to the consent of science, counter
to a formidable array of facts. It is quite wrong, too, to say<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c012'><sup>[189]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>that rhythm nowadays depends upon music to keep it
sound and alive; the rhythm of Tennyson’s <i>Bugle Song</i>,
of Kipling’s <i>Recessional</i>, of any haunting and subtle lyric,
may stir the composer to set it to music, but in no way
depends upon music for its charm. It is quite as wrong
to say that rhythm is less effective now than it has been;
a century that knew Goethe, Heine, Shelley, Tennyson,
not to leave Germanic bounds, has no concessions to make in
this respect. Moreover, the account which the essayist gives
of Arabic verse, as developed from prose, is good until
another account turns up,—say that of M. Hartmann,<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c012'><sup>[190]</sup></a>
where rhythm is beginning and end of the matter; and
it happens that this account is by an Arabic scholar of
repute.</p>

<p class='c013'>Considered in all fairness, these attacks have not shaken
the belief in rhythm as something that lies at the heart of
poetry. They may well brush aside some absurdity of
romantic origin, but they fail to make probable or even possible
a theory which would overthrow a settled literary
tradition touching all quarters of the globe. It cannot be said
that Norden has proved the growth of poetry out of prose
even in the rhetorical clauses of oratory. From Longinus<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c012'><sup>[191]</sup></a>
one learns that an oration among the Greeks had rhythm,
although it was not metrical, and in its delivery stopped just
short of singing; so that one may concede that the speech of
an orator carried to an extreme would give song, while his
harmonious gestures, an art now as good as lost, needed but
little more action and detail to become what the Greeks knew
as a dance. But does any one pretend to say that singing
and dancing spring from individual oratory? Orators now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and then still sing or chant in their speeches. One would
like to know more about the sermons which Dr. Fell preached
“in blank verse”;<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c012'><sup>[192]</sup></a> and one is in doubt whether this phrase,
along with Selden’s sneer<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c012'><sup>[193]</sup></a> at those who “preach in verse,”
meant a distinct metrical order of words or only a sing-song of
the voice—literally “cant,” as in the Puritan sermons and in
the chant common not long ago with preachers of the Society
of Friends. Any one who has heard this “singing” of
hortatory speech knows that the rhythms of regular verse, of
song and dance, could not possibly be derived from it. Each
form of development must be studied for itself under the
control of ethnological and sociological facts; and the written
oration, with its cadences, goes back to the orator and his
listening crowd, just as the written poem goes back to the
improvising poet, and through him to the dancing communal
throng. The attempt to derive exact rhythms of poetry from
loose rhythms of oratorical speech has failed; it remains to
show how these exact rhythms spring from primitive song,
dance, and labour, mainly under communal conditions, and
that exact rhythm lies at the heart of poetry. There are
two social situations to be taken for granted. It is natural
for one person to speak or even to sing, and for ninety-nine
persons to listen. It is also natural for a hundred persons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>under strong emotion, to shout, sing, dance, in concert and
as a throng, not as a matter of active and passive, of give
and take, but in common consent of expression. The second
situation, still familiar now and then, is discouraged by
civilized conditions, although, as foundation of social consent,
it must have preceded the other situation and must have been
of far greater frequency and importance in the beginnings of
social life. It is this state of things which writers like Norden
fail to take into account; and it is this state of things, with
its communal consent resting on the vital and unifying fact
of rhythm, which is now to be positively proved by the
evidence of ethnology, the conclusions of sociology, and the
controlling sense of evolution in poetical as in social progress.</p>

<p class='c013'>In treating the positive side of such a subject, one turns
instinctively to the latest word of science; and it would seem
that the method which combines physical facts with psychological
processes ought to be an adequate court of appeal.
Dr. Ernst Meumann has undertaken a study of this sort with
regard to rhythm;<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c012'><sup>[194]</sup></a> but his investigations do little for the
historical and genetic side of the case. From his essay, to
be sure, one learns much that is of value, and one is made to
see that certain views of rhythm heretofore in vogue must
be considerably modified; for the main question of primitive
rhythm, however, and for historical purposes at large, one
can here learn nothing, since Meumann uses in his research
only that declamatory style of reciting poetry by which the
rhythm is always disguised and usually suppressed.<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c012'><sup>[195]</sup></a> He
denies Paul’s assertion that rhythmic measures in a verse are of
equal duration,—a traditional statement,—because Brücke’s
famous experiments, to which Paul appeals, were made upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>folk who “scanned” their verses and did not recite them.
But, for the purposes just named, it is begging the question
when Meumann rejects the scanning of verse as something
“counter to the nature of poetic material.” What is the
nature of poetic material,—essentially rhythmic, or essentially
free from rhythm? All reports of primitive singing,
that is, of singing among races on a low plane of culture,
make rhythm a wholly insistent element of the verse; and
when a logical explanation which fits modern facts is at odds
with the chronological course of things, then the danger signal
is up for any wary student. It is easy to see that Meumann
could make experiments on nothing but a modern
reading of poetry, and it was natural that he should choose
the sort of reciting most in vogue; his results in such a case,
however, can be valid only for modern conditions. Poetry,
for purposes of public entertainment, is mainly read in the
free, declamatory style. This, to be sure, is not the way in
which Tennyson, a master of poetic form, recited his verses;
it is not the way in which one reads, or ought to read, lyric
poems generally, where even the most ruthless and resolute
Herod of “elocution” finds it impossible to slay all the measures
of three syllables and under; and, by overwhelming
evidence, it is not the way of quite savage folk, who dance
and sing their verses. It is not even the way of races in
more advanced stages of culture,<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c012'><sup>[196]</sup></a> who recited their verses
with strong rhythmical accents, using a harp, or some instrument
of the sort, for additional emphasis. Rhythm is
obscured or hidden by declamation only in times when the
eye has usurped the functions of the ear, and when a highly
developed prose makes the accented rhythm of poetry seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>either old-fashioned or a sign of childhood. Not that one
wishes to restore a sing-song reading, but rather a recognition
of metrical structure, of those subtle effects in rhythm
which mean so much in the poet’s art; verse, in a word, particularly
lyric verse, must not be read as if it were prose.
Dramatic verse is a difficult problem. French and German
actors mainly ignore the rhythm; on the Parisian stage,
competent critics say, whole pages of comedy or tragedy
may be recited with exquisite feeling, and yet without letting
one know whether it is verse or prose that one hears.
For in drama one wishes nowadays to hear not rhythm, but
the thought, the story, the point; imagine Sheridan’s comedies
in verse! Even in tragedy dull emotions are now to be
roused, not keen emotions soothed; or rather it is thought,
penetrated by emotion, to be sure, but thought, and not the
cadence which once soothed and carried off the emotion,—thought,
indeed, as the comment and gloss on emotion,—in
which a modern world wishes to find its consolations and
its æsthetic pleasure. As thought recedes, as one comes
nearer to those primitive emotions which were untroubled by
thought, they get expression more and more in cadenced
tones. And, again, this cadenced emotional expression, as
it grows stronger, grows wider; the barriers of irony and
reserve which keep a modern theatre tearless in the face of
Lear’s most pathetic utterance, break down; first, as one
recedes from modern conditions, comes the sympathetic emotion
of the spectators expressed in sighs and tears,—one
thinks of those performances in Germany a century and a
half ago, and the prodigious weeping that went on,—so that
the emotional expression is echoed; then comes the partial
activity of the spectators by their deputed chorus; and at
last the throng of primitive times, common emotion in common
expression, with no spectators, no audience, no reserve
or comment of thought,—for thought is absorbed in the perception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>and action of communal consent;<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c012'><sup>[197]</sup></a> and here, by all
evidence, rhythm rules supreme. Go back to these conditions,
and what have the tricks of individual accent, the emphasis
of logic, the artistic contrasts, the complicated process
of interpretation, to do with social or gregarious poetry, with
primitive song, with the rhythmic consent of that swaying,
dancing multitude uttering a common emotion as much by
the cadence of step and cry as by articulate words? Ethnology
will be heard in abundance; a word or two may be in
place from comparative literature and philology, and a controlling
idea, a curve of evolution, may be found in this
way if one takes a long stretch of poetic development in
some race just forging to the front of civilized life. Song,
one may assert, passes naturally into a sort of chant, especially
as the epic form of poetry takes shape, into a saying
rather than a singing, and then into an even easier movement.
There seems to be little doubt that the recitation of
classical poetry was a matter of scanning, an utterance which
brought out the metre of the verse; even advocates of prose
as the forerunner of poetry grant that the ancient writers
made a careful distinction between the two, and always
recited metre as metre. Emphasis, moreover, due to the
regular steps of the original dance, is still heard in that popular
verse of four measures which long held its place in
Greek, Latin, Germanic, and other languages; once it accompanied
the dancing throng, and by Westphal’s reckoning<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c012'><sup>[198]</sup></a>
consisted of eight steps forward and as many backward, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>that the companion sounds of the voice made two verses
with four pairs of syllables in each verse, right and left in
step, with one syllable bearing the emphasis. Bergk in 1854
assumed that the hexameter is a combination of two such
verses; Usener, correcting Bergk’s details, added the Nibelungen
verse as made in the same way from two “popular”
verses, that is, from the common Aryan metre, and called
this a “mark of the oldest European verse”<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c012'><sup>[199]</sup></a> wherever
found, still lingering in the folksongs of many peoples.
Bruchmann, noting its occurrence with Malays, Esthonians,
Tartars, concludes that the verse is thus prevalent because
of its convenience for the breath; it is neither too short nor
too long. If, now, the curve of evolution in Aryan verse
begins with an absolutely strict rhythm and alternate emphasis
of syllables, often, as in Iranian,<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c012'><sup>[200]</sup></a> to the neglect of logical
considerations; if the course of poetry is to admit logical
considerations more and more, forcing in at least one case
the abandoning of movable accent and the agreement of
verse-emphasis with syllabic emphasis, an undisputed fact; if
poetry, too, first shakes off the steps of dancing, then the
notes of song, finally the strict scanning of the verse, until
now recited poetry is triumphantly logical, with rhythm as a
subconscious element; if, finally, this process exactly agrees
with the gradual increase of thought over emotion, with the
analogous increase of solitary poetry over gregarious poetry,—then,
surely, one has but to trace back this curve of evolution,
and to project it into prehistoric conditions, in order to
infer with something very close to certitude that rhythm is
the primal fact in the beginnings of the poetic art. Such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>curve is assumed as true by two Germanic scholars who differ
absolutely with regard to certain questions of chronology.
When did the rhythmic, measured chant of Germanic poetry
pass into free recited verse? Before the date of such oldest
Germanic poetry as is preserved, answers Professor Sievers;
not until later, answers Professor Möller. Sievers, it is well
known, declares the Germanic alliterative verse, as it lies
before us, to have been spoken and not chanted; Möller
insists on strophes and a rhythmical chant. To maintain
his view, Möller<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c012'><sup>[201]</sup></a> brings forward certain facts. Germanic
poetry was at first mainly choral and communal song, poetry
of masses of men, the <i>concentus</i>, mentioned by Tacitus, of
warriors moving into battle, or of a tribe dancing at their
religious rites. A <i>concentus</i> of warriors in chorus of battle,
he notes quite happily, is meant not so much to terrify the
foe as to strengthen and order their own emotions, precisely,
one may add, as the communal songs which led to the Hellenic
chorus, and so to tragedy, were at first a matter of
social expression altogether, and not an artistic effort made
by a few active persons for the entertainment of a great passive
throng. So, too, Möller goes on to remark, song in
mass is song in movement; and here a regular cadence
or rhythm must be the first, the absolute condition. “To
say that primitive Aryans had neither poetry nor song—and
nobody says it—would be like saying that they had no
speech; to say that their poetry—and poetry is poetry
only when marked by regular rhythm—had no regular
rhythm, is almost as much as to say that their speech did
not go, even unconsciously, by grammatical rules.” So far
Möller.</p>

<p class='c013'>What has Sievers to say against this? Does he prove his
<i>sprechvortrag</i>, the declamatory recitation of verse, by assuming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>with Wilmanns<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c012'><sup>[202]</sup></a> that Germanic verse is not developed
from any common Aryan rhythm, but rather springs, as
Norden asserted that all verse springs, from the corresponding
parts of balanced sentences in prose? By no means.
Wilmanns argues that this “common Aryan inheritance,”
the verse of four accents, has not been proved as a fact, and
has been simply set up as a theory; moreover, if it is proved,
then one must assume that the Germanic lost it, “for the
four accents appear only in later development.” Because
the alliterative verse follows forms and tones of ordinary
speech, Wilmanns makes it a modification of that speech,
an outgrowth of prose. But that such a development is
unnatural and contrary to facts as well as to common sense,
that song of the masses is the earliest song, that it must be
strictly rhythmic, that it passes later into rhythmic recitation,
and then into free, declamatory recitation,—all this is so
clear to Sievers, however it may seem to work against his
own theory, as in Möller’s argument, that he casts about for
a true explanation of alliterative verse with two accents as the
outcome of that assumed Aryan verse of four accents. On
a hint from Saran,<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c012'><sup>[203]</sup></a> Sievers assumes that Germanic poetry
had already made the step from strophes, which were chanted
or sung in half-verses with four accents, and with a regular
rhythm, to continuous or stichic verses with halves of two
accents, and with free rhythmic structure fitted for saying
rather than for singing. So it might well have gone with
the hexameter; two verses with four accents each became
one verse of six accents, and this had the swing and freedom
of spoken poetry. Now whether Sievers is right or wrong
in all this is apart from the question in hand; it is simply a
matter of evolution on the lines already indicated, and of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>stage in that evolution to which Germanic verse had come.
On the priority of strictly rhythmic verse<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c012'><sup>[204]</sup></a> sung by masses
of men, both Sievers and Möller are agreed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Modern individual recitation, then, by this evidence of
philology and by the sense of evolution in poetic form, can
be no criterion for primitive poetry; hence the inadequate
character of such investigations into the nature of poetic
rhythm as neglect the facts offered by ethnology and by
comparative literature. One must not neglect choral and
communal conditions when one deals with primitive verse.
For a study of modern epic and dramatic verse as it is read
aloud or declaimed, for a study even of verse on the Shaksperian
stage, Meumann’s essay is useful in many respects;
it is useless for the study of rhythm in that larger sweep of
poetic origins and growth.</p>

<p class='c013'>We must turn, then, to scientific material which deals with
primitive stages of human life. A very primitive, perhaps a
pre-primitive stage of human life is involved in Darwin’s
theory, stated in his <i>Descent of Man</i>, reaffirmed briefly in his
book on the expression of emotions, and adopted by Scherer
for the explanation of poetic origins, that a study of sexual
calls from male to female among animals might unlock the
secret of primitive rhythm. This, as has been said, will lead
to no good. Love songs, the supposed development of such
calls, actually diminish and disappear as one retraces the
path of verse and comes to low stages of human progress, to
savage poetry at large;<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c012'><sup>[205]</sup></a> the curve of evolution is against
recourse to facts such as Darwin would find convincing; and
those “long past ages when ... our early progenitors
courted each other by the aid of vocal tones,” are less helpful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>to the understanding of rhythm and poetry, when restored
in such furtive and amiable moments, than when they present
the primitive horde in festal dance and song, finding by
increased ease of movement and economy of force, by keener
sense of kind, by delight of repetition, the possibilities of that
social consent which is born of rhythmic motion. Scherer,
indeed, saw how much more this social consent and this
festal excitement have to do with the matter, and undertook
to fix the origin of poetry in an erotic and pantomimic choral,
such as one still finds in certain obscene Australian dances;<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c012'><sup>[206]</sup></a>
but the erotic impulse is not social, save in some questionable
exceptions; and social consent, as Donovan has shown, began
rather on public and frankly social occasions, like the dance
of a horde after victory in war.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c012'><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Sociological considerations, again, have weight with Mr.
Herbert Spencer<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c012'><sup>[208]</sup></a> when he finds, like Norden, but for different
reasons, that rhythm, as used in poetry and in music, is
developed out of highly emotional and passionate speech.
This doctrine of Mr. Spencer has been denied on musical
grounds, and must be denied still more strongly on ethnological
grounds. The objections on musical grounds brought
forward by Mr. Gurney,<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c012'><sup>[209]</sup></a> are difficult to answer, and one is
bound to admit that Mr. Spencer has not answered them
convincingly in the essay of 1890; moreover, in making
recitative a step between speech and song, he is not only
ignoring communal singing, but is reversing the facts of an
evolutionary process. To develop song out of an impassioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>speech is plausible enough until one fronts this primitive
horde dancing, singing, shouting in cadence, with a rhythm
which the analogy of ethnological evidence and the facts of
comparative literature prove to have been exact.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c012'><sup>[210]</sup></a> In Mr.
Spencer’s essay of 1857, the “connate” character of dancing,
poetry, and music is emphasized; but the choral, communal
element is unnoticed. Precisely such social conditions, however,
controlled the beginning of poetry, and the main factor
in them seems to have been the exact rhythm of communal
consent. Against the evidence for communal rhythm little can
be urged; and the few cases brought forward for this purpose
by Biedermann not only rest on imperfect observation but
often prove to be contradictory in the form of the statement.
So, too, with other evidence. Burchell, for example, said that
the Bushmen in singing and dancing showed an exact sense of
rhythm; while Daumas said that they never danced except
after heavy meals, and then in wild, disordered fashion, with
no rhythm at all. Grosse<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c012'><sup>[211]</sup></a> throws out this negative evidence
as counter to overwhelming evidence on the other side. Again,
one often finds a statement which denies rhythm to savage
poetry, nevertheless affirming most exact rhythm in the songs
or cries to which the savages dance. Here is evidently a confusion
of the communal “poem” or song, and the individual
tale or what not chanted in a kind of recitative. It may be concluded
from a careful study of ethnological evidence that all
savage tribes have the communal song, and most of them have
the recitative. Silent folk who do nothing of the sort, tribes
that neither sing nor dance, must not be brought into the argument;
if they do occur, and the negative fact is always hard
to establish, they are clearly too abnormal to count. Human
intelligence is not measured by the idiot. These are decadent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>groups, extreme degenerates, links severed from the chain; and
no one will summon as witnesses for the primitive stage of
poetry those Charruas of Uruguay, who are said to have no
dance, no song, no social amusements, who speak only in a
whisper, “are covered with vermin,” and know neither religion
nor laws,—in a word, no social existence, and almost no humanity.
So one comes back to the normal folk. East Africans<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c012'><sup>[212]</sup></a> are
reported to have “no metrical songs,” and they sing in recitative;
but at once it is added that they dance in crowds to the
rhythm of their own voices, as well as to the drum, moving in
cadence with the songs which they sing: and here can be
no recitative.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c012'><sup>[213]</sup></a> Moreover, when cleaning rice, they work to
the rhythm of songs, to foot-stamping and hand-clapping of
the bystanders,—in other words, choral dance, choral song,
exact time, rhythm absolute; although, by culling a bit here
and there, the theorist could have presented fine evidence
from Bushmen and East Africans that savages in low levels
of culture have no rhythm in their songs, and dance without
consent or time. True, there is the recitative, and that, as a
thing interesting to Europeans, is pushed into the foreground
of the traveller’s account. Yet this recitative of the singer
who does a turn for the missionary or other visitor is not the
main fact in the case, although it is often the only fact of the
sort that is set down. It may be cheerfully conceded that
the recitative occurs among savage tribes throughout the
world; but the manner of its occurrence must be considered.
Along with choral singing, in intervals of the dance, some
person chants a sentence or two in a fashion usually described
as recitative. One would like to know more of this chanting;
but sometimes it is without exact rhythm or measure,
and will not “scan” in any regular way. So, too, with
music itself; most of the ruder tribes, as Wallaschek points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>out,<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c012'><sup>[214]</sup></a> know both systems of music, the rhythmic and the
“free.” On the Friendly Islands natives have two kinds of
song, “those similar to our recitative, and others in regular
measure.” African singers tell a tale of their wanderings
“in an emphatic recitative”; but the choral songs are always
sung in exact rhythm to the dance. Not only, too, with
savages; hasty generalizations and inexact statements due to
this double character of singing have robbed more advanced
peoples of the rhythmical sense. A Swedish writer<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c012'><sup>[215]</sup></a> telling
about the Lapps and what seemed to him their lack of any
idea of melody, quotes one Blom, who “denies that the Lapps
have any sense for rhythm.” Why? They cannot keep
harmony; of six or eight, no two agree, and each is a bit
above or below the rest,—not a question of rhythm, then,
and alien to the case. Scarcely any savages have the sense of
melody and harmony, although their sense of exact rhythm
is universal and profound.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not hard to follow so plain a hint as one finds in the
ethnological evidence; and it is clear that recitative is a
matter of the individual singer, while to choral singing it is
unknown and from the nature of the case impossible. As
the savage laureate slips from the singing, dancing crowd,
which turns audience for the nonce, and gives his short improvisation,
only to yield to the refrain of the chorus, so the
actual habit of individual composition and performance has
sprung from the choral composition and performance. The
improvisations and the recitative are short deviations from
the main road, beginnings of artistry, which will one day
become journeys of the solitary singer over pathless hills of
song, those “wanderings of thought” which Sophocles has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>noted; and the curve of evolution in the artist’s course can
show how rapidly and how far this progress has been made.
But the relation must not be reversed; and if any fact seems
established for primitive life, it is the precedence of choral
song and dance. An entertainer and an audience, an artist
and a public, take for granted preceding social conditions;
and it is generally admitted that social conditions begin with
the festal dance as well as with communal labour. Indeed,
as Professor Grosse points out, rhythm was the chief factor
in social “unification”; but this was never the rhythm of
Norden’s rhythmical prose, or the irregular measures of a
recitative. Where and when the individual recitative became
a thing of prominence, as it undoubtedly did, is a matter to
be studied in the individual and centrifugal impulse, in the
progress of the poet; here it is enough to show that rhythmic
verse came directly from the choral song, and that neither
the choral song, nor any regular song, could have come from
the recitative. The latter, as Jacobsthal assures us, will not
go with dancing; and earliest singing, as is still the case in
Africa,<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c012'><sup>[216]</sup></a> must not be sundered from the dance. Baker,<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c012'><sup>[217]</sup></a> who
made a careful study of music among our Indians, sums up
the matter by saying that “the characteristic feature of primitive
song was the collectiveness of amusement,” and that
“recitatives have a flow of words and a clearness of expression
which are both incompatible with primitive song.” They
need, that is, a developed stage of speech when the logical
sentence has shaken itself free, to some extent, of mere emotional
cadence and of almost meaningless repetitions. Here,
indeed, begin the orator, the teller of tales, the artistic poet;
but dance, song, and poetry itself begin with a communal
consent, which is expressed by the most exact rhythm. Emotional
speech is an ambiguous phrase. In one sense it is an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>individual, broken, irregularly regular sequence of phrases
and words; oratory and oratorical cadences came out of such
a chaos, but never the ordered rhythm of dancing throngs.
The emotional speech in which exact rhythm began was the
loud and repeated crying of a throng, regulated and brought
into consent by movements of the body, and getting significance
from the significance of the festal occasion.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c012'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Evidence is everywhere for the asking in this matter
of communal consent and choral rhythm; but instead of
taking detached and random facts from many different
sources, it will be well to select three groups of facts which
can offer in each case compact and consistent testimony.
For the present purpose one may look at the case of the
Botocudos of South America, a tribe very low in the social
scale, as studied by Dr. Ehrenreich; at the case of the Eskimos
as studied by Dr. Boas; and finally at the case of African
negroes in this country, studied by Colonel Higginson
thirty-five years ago, under most favourable circumstances,
and with particular reference to their communal singing.
With all respect for the zeal and truthfulness of missionaries,
one will thus do well to leave them out of the account, and
to take evidence which comes in two cases from a professed
ethnologist and in the third case from an impartial observer.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>The Botocudos<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c012'><sup>[219]</sup></a> are little better than a leaderless horde,
and pay scant heed to their chieftain; they live only for
their immediate bodily needs, and take small thought for the
morrow, still less thought for the past. No traditions, no
legends, are abroad to tell them of their forbears. They
still use gestures to express feeling and ideas; while the
number of words which imitate a given sound “is extraordinarily
great.” An action or an object is named by imitating
the sound peculiar to it; and sounds are doubled to express
greater intensity or a repetition. To speak is <i>aõ</i>; to speak
loudly, or to sing, is <i>aõ-aõ</i>. And now for their æsthetic
life, their song, dance, poetry, as described by this accurate
observer. “On festal occasions the whole horde meets by
night round the camp fire for a dance. Men and women
alternating ... form a circle; each dancer lays his arms
about the necks of his two neighbours, and the entire ring
begins to turn to the right or to the left, while all the dancers
stamp strongly and in rhythm the foot that is advanced, and
drag after it the other foot. Now with drooping heads they
press closer and closer together; now they widen the circle.
Throughout the dance resounds a monotonous song to the
time of which they stamp their feet. Often one can hear
nothing but a continually repeated <i>kalauī ahā!</i> ... again,
however, short improvised songs in which are told the doings
of the day, the reasons for rejoicing, what not, as ‘Good
hunting,’ or ‘Now we have something to eat,’ or ‘Brandy
is good.’<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c012'><sup>[220]</sup></a> Now and then, too, an individual begins a song,
and is answered by the rest in chorus.... <i>They never sing</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span><i>without dancing, never dance without singing, and have but
one word to express both song and dance.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>As the unprejudiced reader sees, this clear and admirable
account confirms the doctrine of early days, revived with
fresh ethnological evidence in the writings of Dr. Brown
and of Adam Smith, that dance, poetry, and song were once
a single and inseparable function; and is in itself fatal to the
idea of rhythmic prose, of solitary recitation, as foundation
of poetry. The circle, the close clasp, the rhythmic consent
of steps and voices; here are the social foundation and the
communal beginnings of the art. Then comes the improvised
song, springing, however, from these communal and
choral conditions, and still referring absolutely to present
interests of the horde as a whole. There are no traditions,
no legends, no epic, no lyrics of love, no hymns to star and
sunset. All poetry is communal, holding fast to the rhythm
of consent as to the one sure fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Eskimo,<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c012'><sup>[221]</sup></a> despite his surroundings, is in better social
case than the Botocudo; while the sense of kind is as great,
individual growth has gone further, and song is not limited
to festal and communal promptings. The “entertainer” has
arrived, although, when he begins to divert his little audience
in the snow-hut, he must always turn his face to the wall.
Still more, there is no monopoly; as with peasants at the
Bavarian dance, where each must and can sing his own
improvised quatrain, so here each member of the party has
his tale to tell, his song, dance, or trick. The women hum
incessantly while at work; but the words are mainly that
monotonous air, the repeated <i>amna aya</i> of the popular chorus.
Individuals have their “own” tunes and songs, which easily
become traditional; but the solitary song is not so much an
Eskimo characteristic as the communal song, for they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>a sociable folk, and never spend their evenings alone. They
sing, as so often was the case in mediæval Europe, while
playing ball; but the combination of choral song and dance
is a favourite form, and both singing and dancing have in
this case one name, with features common to the festivity
all over the world,—exact rhythm, repetition of word and
phrase, endless chorus, a fixed refrain,—the <i>amna aya</i>,—short
and intermittent improvisation by solitary singers and
reciters. The art of these singers and reciters is in an advanced
stage; for they perform alone as well as under support
of the chorus. Three phases of their art may be
mentioned. First, there is the prose tale with songs or recitatives
interspersed, a sort of <i>cante-fable</i>. Then there is the
tale chanted in a kind of recitative, which Dr. Boas calls
poetic prose. Thirdly, there are “real poems of a very
marked rhythm, which are not sung but recited,” and the
reciter “jumps up and down and to right and left” as he
speaks his piece. That is, here are tales which have come
to such a pitch of art that choral and refrain and repetition
of words are a hindrance to the flow of the story. Still, even
here the solitary performances stand out against the background
of choral singing in which they once formed such a
modest part, and on every provocation they slip into it again
and are lost in the old rhythm of emotional repetition and
communal consent.</p>

<p class='c013'>The negro slaves of the South, finally, with their traditional
dance and song, strangely influenced by one of the few elements
of civilization which really came into their life, the
religious element, offer another interesting bit of evidence to
show how emotional speech, a rude poetry, is born of rhythm
by consent of a throng. In those so-called “spirituals” of
the negro is the recitative or the chorus to be looked upon
as original? Perhaps Colonel Higginson had as good a
chance to study this communal song as any one could have;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>in an article<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c012'><sup>[222]</sup></a> written soon after the war he described the
singing of the “spirituals” by men of his regiment, now in
camp, now on the march, now to the fall of the oars. He
speaks of the trait so prominent in all primitive song, exact
and inevitable rhythm, however harsh the voices and however
uncouth the words. “Often ... I have ... silently
approached some glimmering fire, round which the dusky
figures moved in the rhythmical barbaric dance the negroes
call a ‘shout,’ chanting, often harshly, but always in the
most perfect time, some monotonous refrain.” What was the
favourite of all these spirituals, “sung perhaps twice as often
as any other”? A song called <i>Hold Your Light</i>, “sung with
no accompaniment but the measured clapping of hands and
the clatter of many feet;” it “properly consisted of a chorus
alone with which the verses of other songs might be combined
at random.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hold your light, Brudder Robert,—</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Hold your light,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hold your light on Canaan’s shore....</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>For Robert, another name would be given,<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c012'><sup>[223]</sup></a> then another, and
so on for half an hour. This seemed to Colonel Higginson
“the simplest primitive type of ‘spiritual.’” Next in favour
was:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Jordan River, I’m bound to go,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Bound to go, bound to go,</div>
      <div class='line'>Jordan River, I’m bound to go,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And bid ’em fare ye well,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>then with Brudder Robert, Sister Lucy, and so on, the well-known
cumulative refrain. Now if one had only the text of
many of these songs, and knew nothing of the singing and
dancing, one would call them rhythmical prose, recitative;
for example, a part of <i>The Coming Day</i>. One is told, however,
that this “was a boat-song and timed well with the tug
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>of the oar.” The fact is that here, as in savage and presumably
in primitive song, movement of body and rhythm of
voice are the main consideration, while the words, on which
civilized man imposes individual and syntactic correctness,
are of very subordinate value. Syllables may be dropped or
added at will, but the rhythm must be exact; and the simplest
way to avoid verbal distress is the primitive device of
repetition.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c012'><sup>[224]</sup></a> When the words, and the thought in them,
begin to be of overmastering importance in poetry, “scanning”
acts as deputy of exact rhythm and song, until at last
declamation pushes scanning aside, and rhythm is reduced
to the same ancillary function once assigned to thought and
words.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here, then, are the vital elements in the discussion.
Rhythm is an affair of instinctive perception transformed
into a social act as the expression of social consent. It has
been said that beginnings and not origins are the object of
our quest; how rhythm in poetry may stand to rhythm in
nature, to the breath or the pulse of man, to periodic movements
of tide, of star, and so in vaster and vaster cosmic
relation, or, again, to infinitesimal rhythms in the cell, in the
cell of the cell,—are queries apart from the present purpose.
Important, however, is the doctrine held by modern
scholars that poetic rhythm is objectively an outcome of human
activity, and subjectively a process of human perception.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c012'><sup>[225]</sup></a>
Perhaps the best short study of the wider question has been
made by Wallaschek.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c012'><sup>[226]</sup></a> Insisting that “rhythm is the form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>of the objective movement, time-sense (<i>mesure</i>, <i>takt</i>) the form
of the perceiving subject-mind,” noting that “the evenness of
time-groups in music arises from the original organic union
of dance and music,” he goes on to point out a fact which
seems to be fundamental for any study of beginnings in
poetry as well as in the sister art, although it is music of
which he speaks. Vocal utterance merely as result of “corporal
stimulus,” song like that of birds, is not yet music,—nor,
one may add, is the cry of the solitary infant, individual
or racial, to be counted as poetry. “The peculiar germ which
has alone been found capable of the enormous development
actually accomplished in music”—and in poetry—“is the
<i>chorus</i>, with its framework, the dance.” A bird’s song or a
man’s cry is merely vent for emotion; but when several persons
sing together, there is more than emotion, there is consent,
and consent means that they must observe, group, and
order the tones. “They could not keep together if they did
not mark periods ... for there is no concert possible without
bars. What they perform is rhythm, what they think is
<i>takt</i>, and what they feel is surplus of vigour.” There may be
some error in the details of this analysis. Wallaschek has not
done justice to the “genesis of emotion,” as Ribot<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c012'><sup>[227]</sup></a> calls it,
through unaided rhythm; he may not concede enough to the
song of birds, and may be wrong in saying that no one ever
heard animals sing in concert;<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c012'><sup>[228]</sup></a> hysteric cries, which tend
to be rhythmic and show a maximum of emotion with a
minimum of purpose, have doubtless more to say in early
rhythm—one thinks of the songs of lament, the <i>voceri</i>—than
he admits;<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c012'><sup>[229]</sup></a> but his main point about choral beginnings is of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>immense importance. Poetry, like music, is social; like its
main factor, rhythm, it is the outcome of communal consent,
a <i>faculté d’ensemble</i>; and this should be writ large over
every treatise on poetry, in order to draw the mind of the
reader from that warped and baffling habit which looks upon
all poetry as a solitary performance. The modern reader
is passive; even hearing poetry is mainly foreign to him;
active poetry, such as abounded in primitive life, is to him the
vagary of a football mob, the pleasure of school children; and
to such a reader the words of Wallaschek are salutary indeed,
insisting that not the sense of hearing alone is to be studied
when one takes up the psychology of music, but the muscular
sense as well, and that the muscular sense has precedence.
“‘Making music’ means in the primitive world
performing, not listening,” a statement which applies as well
to poetry. And what sort of rhythm, under leave of Norden
and the rest, is one to assume for the primitive consent
whether in music or in poetry? Well, earliest music shows
“an unsettled melody, an uncertain and constantly varying
intonation, a perpetual fluctuation of pitch,” but, contrasted
with all this, “the strict and ever prevailing rhythm,” “the
precision and marvellously exact performance of numberless
performers.”<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c012'><sup>[230]</sup></a> For two facts, then, of great moment in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>study of poetry, there is universal testimony from savage
tribes all over the earth. Singing is mainly choral and timed
to the dance; and the rhythm, no matter how large the throng,
is amazingly correct.</p>

<p class='c013'>So much for the savages. Arguments from the study of
children, as was said in foregoing remarks on method, should
be applied with great caution to the history of literary forms.
It may be noted, however, that nothing brought out thus far by
such studies has worked against the assumption of extremely
accurate rhythm as the fundamental fact in primitive poetry.
Of course, one must not set a child to tasks that belong in mature
stages of poetry. The early efforts of children to make a
metrical composition<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c012'><sup>[231]</sup></a> are generally rough and only approximately
rhythmic. Repeat a few verses, and ask the child to
make verses like them, giving him paper, pencil, solitude,
encouragement, and the promise of cake, all the known aids
by which an adult poet wins his peerage or the abbey; the
child will probably hit a rime or so, more or less accurate,
but the verse will halt. This, however, is easily explained.
Solitary composition, the process of following a set form of
sounds by making sentences of his own to fit the scheme,
the combination of thought with rhythm, is a task beyond
his powers, and for an excellent reason; it was also beyond
the powers of primitive man. But let the same child, with a
dozen other children, in an extemporized game, fall to crying
out some simple phrase in choral repetition; the rhythm is
almost painful in its exactness. Repeat to this child rimes
of the nursery; he is sworn foe to defective metre, and
boggles at it; indeed, such defects are hard to find in all the
amiable nonsense. The child’s ear for rhythm is acute; his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>execution of it in choral, or in verse learned from the hearing,
is precise; his demands upon it are of the strictest; but
in solitary composition, a mental effort, he loses his rhythmic
way, and grows bewildered in those new paths of thought.
A teacher of considerable experience recently made the statement
that children in school will turn loose or defective metre,
once the idea of rhythm is given them, into accurately measured
verse. Indeed, it is probable that the halting verses of an
indifferent poet, such as one finds in newspapers, begin in
the maker’s constructive process as correct rhythm, but lose
this cadence in the course of composition.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c012'><sup>[232]</sup></a> Be that as it
may be, however, the rhythmical sense of children is remarkably
exact for purposes of choral singing and recital.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is evident that one is not likely to be embarrassed by a
lack of rhythm in early poetry, but rather by a lack of anything
else. There is the danger, when one has made so
much of rhythm, that this early art will be called nothing
more than vocal music, and will vainly claim the title of
poetry. Here are dance and music, one is told, and that is
all. Wagner<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c012'><sup>[233]</sup></a> believed in the original union of the three
arts; but Wallaschek<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c012'><sup>[234]</sup></a> separates poetry from music and
dance. Unfortunately, he does not say what primitive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>poetry could have been; recitative he rejects utterly; it is
clear, however, that he is thinking of a poetry which no one
is disposed to father upon earliest man, that poetry of thought
and syntactic statement familiar to later days. Poetry, he
says, always depends upon the intellect. Far better, because
clearer and in closer accord with ethnological facts, are the
brief statement of Ribot and the elaborate theory of Donovan.
Ribot,<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c012'><sup>[235]</sup></a> considering as a matter of fact how spontaneous
movements pass into creative and æsthetic activity, finds
by all evidence at hand that dancing in pantomime was the
“primordial” and universal art, and that it was composite,
“including the rudimentary form of two acts destined later
on to separate in the course of their evolution,—music and
poetry. Poor music, indeed, ... but remarkable for the
strictness of rhythm and measure, and poor poetry, consisting
in a short sentence incessantly repeated, or even in monosyllables
without precise signification.” That is a clear
statement; but it takes for granted, in some measure, what
Donovan tries to prove,—the festal origin of speech.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c012'><sup>[236]</sup></a>
Whether Donovan does prove this or not, he makes it
perfectly clear that the vocal music, which Wallaschek
separated from poetry without giving an idea what poetry
was and how it began, was itself poetry, and had functions
which expressed the human emotions of that time as well
as the most finished poem expresses modern emotion and
thought. With the philological arguments we are not concerned,
and, indeed, theories about the origin of language
have always been kittle cattle to shoe; we are concerned,
however, with these four elements of a primitive festal
gathering: bodily play-movements, rhythmical beating, some
approach to song, and some degree of communal interest.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Of these, the first and the fourth are fused in dancing, which
begins as a celebration of victory, and is found later in the
harvesting of a crop and in the vintage. “Communal elation
following success in a common enterprise” is the earliest
occasion for social consent of the festal type; and it finds
expression in imitating that successful act, along with
“rhythmic beating,”<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c012'><sup>[237]</sup></a> and with excited individual cries
which are brought into rhythm with the steps, the gestures
and the “beating” itself. Hence speech and song. In his
second article, Donovan tries to trace the process by which
meaning got into these cries, and how they led to grammatical
forms of speech; what interests us here is the
exactness, the prevalence, the dominant force of rhythm as
foundation of consent, and so of social act, dance, song, word.
As with savages now, so with primitive man, however wild
and confused the social mass may be, rhythm is at the heart
of their social life. Here is the point of order in the chaos;
and one may safely assume that such order and precision of
mere sounds would be the obvious stay for all efforts to give
them meaning and connection. Language, after all, is communication.
This is probably what Donovan means when
he makes rhythm the prime social factor, the bridge from
merely animal to human; rhythmic forms, he says, are
“witnesses of a lower stage of progress than any yet known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>to anthropological records,”—the “stage of the passage
between brute and man”; and he gives modern philology
food for thought when he declares that many facts and
considerations “run counter to the notion that song, or
rhythmical and poetical forms, must be supervening embellishments
of speech which imply a certain height of civilization.”
A chapter in his earlier book<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c012'><sup>[238]</sup></a> goes more into the
details of communal poetry under primitive conditions, and
answers objections which might be made to this poetical
function of the throng. A happily chosen verse from
Horace enforces the deprecation of that habit which now
makes a poet’s muse the poet himself or else an amiable
fiction. The earliest “muse” was simply that “music” or
rhythm of the throng which held up the singer’s tottering
personality in his first steps over the burning marle of individual
expression before the throng itself—still a nervous
matter!—and prompted or sustained his improvisations;
for primitive man this muse was the cadence of falling
feet, rhythmic cries, social consent. And how came those
“higher artistic interests connected with speech out of the
pantomimic and choral dance?” Direct evidence, Donovan
remarks, is meagre; but of indirect evidence there is a
“mighty mass.” Hindu words for the drama go back to
the word which means to dance. Hellenic drama has an
even more definite development of the same sort. European
lyric poetry grew out of the choral dance; and folksongs
which sprang directly from “the spontaneous elation of the
crowd,” though rare, still occur even now in Greece, Italy,
Russia, Hungary.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c012'><sup>[239]</sup></a> Accentual verse is “the natural inheritance
of poetry which grew from the fusion of rhythms and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>tones and words. The words uttered by a rude people spontaneously,
and during the elation produced through following
the movements of the dance and listening to the accompanying
tones, were obliged to assume the natural impulsive element
of rhythm.” Horace, in a familiar passage, tells how
the artist began his work with this choral and communal
material<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c012'><sup>[240]</sup></a> now unknown except in survivals like the refrain
of harvest songs:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>per audaces nova dithyrambos</div>
      <div class='line in8'>verba devolvit,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>new words, that is, instead of the old choral repetitions.
That these communal songs, however, were poetry in themselves
seems sufficiently proved. The objection urged by
Wallaschek, that rhythmic sounds were inadequate to the
demands of poetry, falls flat for the negative reason that
nowhere else can poetry be found under primitive conditions,
and for the positive reason that these rhythmic sounds were
unquestionably full of communal significance and may well
have served as the raw material of speech itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>So far the theory of social consent as the basis of rhythm
and the foundation of poetry has been supported mainly by
the dance. This play-theory, this festal origin, may be accepted
as probable; but it must leave room and verge enough
for the part played by labour. Human society was organized
in the spirit of a grim struggle for life; and human labour
under social conditions is a main part of the struggle. Professor
Karl Bücher’s essay on Labour and Rhythm<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c012'><sup>[241]</sup></a> is meant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>in part as a sociological study of the beginnings of poetry; it
has been greeted everywhere as an important contribution to
our positive knowledge of the case; and a summary of it is
unavoidable for the matter now in hand.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c012'><sup>[242]</sup></a> His argument is
clear. Fatigue, which besets all work felt as work by reason
of its continued application of purpose, vanished for primitive
man as it vanishes now for children, if the work was once
freed from this stress of application and so turned to a kind
of play. The dance itself is really hard work, exacting and
violent; what makes it the favourite it is with savages as with
children? Simply its automatic, regular, rhythmic character,
the due repetition of a familiar movement which allows the
mind to relax its attitude of constant purpose. The purpose
and plan of work involve external sources and external ends;
rhythm is instinctive, and springs from the organic nature of
man; it is no invention.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c012'><sup>[243]</sup></a> The song that one sings while at
work is not something fitted to the work, but comes from
movements of the body in the specific acts of labour; and
this applies not only to the rhythm, but even to the words.<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c012'><sup>[244]</sup></a>
So it was in the festal dance. That primitive man was less
impeded in bodily movements than is now the case, and that
these movements were more marked; that the rigorously
exact movement begat a rigorously exact rhythm, to which at
first half meaningless sounds and then words were joined,
often lingering in later days as a refrain of field or spinning-room—witness
the pantomimic action which goes with the
words of that New Zealand planting-song, and a host of similar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>survivals; that poetry and music were always combined
by early man, and, along with labour, made up the primitive
three-in-one, an organic whole, labour being the basal fact,
with rhythm as element common to the three;<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c012'><sup>[245]</sup></a> and that not
harmony or pitch, but this overmastering and pervasive
rhythm, exact, definite, was the main factor of early song,—these
are conclusions for which Bücher offers ample and convincing
evidence. In particular we may look, first, at his conclusion
against unrhythmic poetry, then at his theory of
rhythmic origins, and finally at his study of individual and
social labour. For the first, he remarks, as all students of ethnology
have remarked, that primitive folk care little for melody;
the main, the only musical element in their songs is
rhythm. Rhythm is not bound up with speech as speech,
and must come to it from without; for mere observation and
development of the rhythmical tendencies inherent in language
could not have led to the fact of rhythm as known to
primitive man. The main external source of rhythm, then,
is the habit of accompanying bodily movements with sounds
of the voice, and these bodily movements were primarily
movements in man’s work. Taking such songs of labour as
still remain, Bücher finds that the more primitive these are,
the closer relation they have with the labour itself. The
rhythm, too, is fixed by the movement; words change at will
and are mostly improvised. Briefly, Bücher adds one more
answer to that old question about the origins of poetry, and
finds them chiefly in the labour of primitive man, where energetic
and continual movements of an instinctively rhythmic
nature begat “not only the form but the material” of poetry.
The same rhythmic succession of rise and fall is common to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>labour and to verse; and as for the words, these came not
from bodily exertion, but from the sounds produced by the
work itself, sounds like the noise of the feet in treading, like
the blows of a primitive implement, which irresistibly provoked
accompaniment by the voice. That these sounds had
a meaning vague at first, then sharper, clearer, and connected
with the cause, conditions, and purpose of the work, is lawful
inference. Words that so took their places in the regular and
inexorable rhythm of work or dance must share in that regularity;
recitative, or the rhythm of easy prose, has no place
under such conditions, and Bücher rejects it utterly. Again,
all human work began with movements of arms and legs
“which instinctively move in rhythm.” With Bücher’s further
development of this theory, that beating and stamping,
earliest forms of work, plus the human voice which followed
the rise and fall of the labour, are the basis of metrical “feet”;
that iamb and trochee are stamping measures, spondee a
measure of striking or beating, still easy to note where two
hands strike in rhythm; that dactyl and anapæst can be heard
at the forge of any blacksmith whose main blow on the iron
is either followed or preceded by two shorter, lighter blows,—with
these attractive but minor considerations one may agree
or disagree, but the vital fact of rhythm as the pulse of earliest
human labour and play, of earliest poetry, of earliest
music, is vastly strengthened by the evidence and the arguments
set forth in this admirable essay.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the matter of individual and social<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c012'><sup>[246]</sup></a> labour, Bücher has
inference and hints, but hardly a developed theory. It is
easy, however, to infer that stress is to be laid on the social
rather than on individual conditions. In play and the dance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>this is everywhere conceded. To tread the winepress alone,
however the instinctively and unavoidably rhythmic movement
might provoke one to song, was a small factor in rhythmic
development when compared with the consent of many
feet treading in joy of the vintage.<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c012'><sup>[247]</sup></a> For individual labour,
songs of women grinding at the mill, once a most wearisome
task, are the best example; and hints of these, even scraps of
actual song, are found in plenty.<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c012'><sup>[248]</sup></a> But two women and more
were often to be found grinding together, and the social consent
of such songs must have been at least as frequent as the
lonely voice. Bücher points out, moreover, how the solitary
act of labour, particularly with heavy tools, tends to be uncertain
and unrhythmic, and how the addition of a second workman,
say at the forge, or in threshing or in ramming stones,
at once induces an exact rhythm, the rhythm born of consent.
This is a primitive process and most important. The idea of
savages as capricious, and therefore not acting in concert, is
a hasty inference, true only to a certain point; for it is civilized
folk who work independently, and it is the uncivilized
who must cling to rhythm both in work and in play, since
nowhere else are men found so dependent on concerted automatic
work as in savage life. A man of advanced culture
thinks out his own labour, and does it in his own way; his
concert of work with other men is a higher synthesis of individual
performances which is unknown to the savage. All
this opens to our eyes the spectacle of a long evolution, at
one end of which, the uncertain, tentative beginnings of
social life, we see human beings acting, alike in the tasks
and in the pleasures of their time, with a minimum of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>thought and a maximum of rhythm; while at the hither end
is a highly developed society, where the monotonous whir of
machinery has thrust out the old cadence and rhythm of
man’s labour, where strenuous and solitary wanderings replace
the communal dance, and where every brow is marked
with the burden of incessant thought.</p>

<p class='c013'>The threads of evidence, then, all end in one point close
to that blackness of thick darkness which veils the life of
earliest man; at this point, the point of social consent, work
is not far from play, and art is still in solution with practical
life. The arts of movement, of music, dance, poetry, are in
evidence only along with the arts of subsistence and tribal
life, with the labour, actual or reminiscent, of primitive social
conditions; while the arts that take permanent form, such
as sculpture and painting, appear only in the results of this
labour as rude forms of ornament. What holds together
these heterogeneous elements is rhythm, “the ordered grouping
of movements, as they occur in temporal succession,” so
Bücher defines it; and it is rhythm which must count, by his
reckoning, as one of the greatest factors in social development,
a function, too, not out of date even under existing
conditions of life.</p>

<p class='c013'>So much by way of proof, and it seems conclusive, for
rhythm as the fundamental fact of poetry. True, it is not
the fundamental fact for modern consideration, which goes
below the surface and seeks a deeper meaning, asking for
the nobly imaginative and for that mingling of the emotional
and the intellectual which submits “the shows of things to
the desires of the mind”; it is not even the overwhelming
element in modern poetic form. Naked limbs no longer
move unimpeded in the dance, no longer stand out free and
bold as they tread the winepress; naked and insistent rhythm,
too, is, for the most part, so hidden by draperies of verbal expression,
that one is fain to call it no essential factor in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>poetic process. Modern art, deliberate and intellectual, turns
in scorn upon that helpless poetry of the horde, as Prospero
upon Caliban:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in28'>I pitied thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour</div>
      <div class='line'>One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,</div>

      <div class='line'>A thing most brutish, I endow’d thy purposes</div>
      <div class='line'>With words that made them known.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Imperious thought is ashamed of this mere regularity, this
recurrence, this common gift; where is the art in it? Art,
said Schiller, must have something in its work that is voluntary,
fresh, surprising; the voice, he said, may be beautiful,
but there is no beauty in mere breathing. Has not poetry,
then, it may be asked, gained in meaning for mankind, in
nobility and dignity, precisely as it has loosed the bands of
rhythm, forsworn this ignoble and slavish regularity, receded
from the throng, spurned the chorus, turned to solitary places,
and cherished the individual, the artist, the poet? Granting
the throng, the dance, the rhythm, the shouts, is not all this
but poetry in the nebular state, and does not real poetry
begin where Aristotle makes it begin, when an individual
singer detaches himself from the choral mass, improvises
and recites his verses, and so sets out upon that “mindward”
way which leads to Sophocles and Dante and Shakspere?
We do not dance Shakspere’s poetry, we do not sing it, we
hardly even scan it; why then this long pother about a lapsing
and traditional form?</p>

<p class='c013'>Well, in the first place, rhythm is there in Sophocles,
Dante, Shakspere; it was sung to large extent in the drama
of Sophocles, and even with Dante and Shakspere it is subconsciously
present in the mind of every sympathetic reader
who accepts the verses by those poor deputies of aural perception,
the eyes. Not the least of artistic triumphs in poetry
are concerned directly with rhythm. Those lines of <i>Hamlet</i>,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Absent thee from felicity awhile,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>are poetry through their harmony of rhythmic adjustment, and
if divorced from rhythm cease to be poetry. Every good
lyric, even in modern times, fairly trembles and prays to be
sung, at least to be taken in its full rhythmic force; the
“pastel in prose” only serves to send us back to genuine
lyric with a new love of rhythmic regularity. In modern
dramatic, epic, and incidental poetry, the case is different;
but this difference brings no loss to the cause of rhythm.
One does not wish to read <i>Under the Greenwood Tree</i> in verse
any more than one wishes to read <i>As You Like It</i> in prose.
Meredith’s <i>Egoist</i>, an epic prose comedy of modern life, is
as satisfactory in its way, barring the comparisons of genius,
as <i>Twelfth Night</i> or <i>Much Ado</i>, the dramatic comedy in verse.
It is our keen thinking, fastened upon a character like Sir
Willoughby, like Malvolio, that is in question; and those
soothing cadences which appeal to the consciousness of kind
and set the solitary in sympathetic throngs, as in a lyric, we
do not need. Satire of emotional traits, to be sure, may
require the exaggeration of verse as in <i>Jump-to-Glory Jane</i>;
but verse is not degraded by this, any more than it is
degraded in helping one to remember the number of days
in a month. The hold of rhythm upon modern poetry, even
under conditions of analytic and intellectual development
which have unquestionably worked for the increased importance
of prose, is a hold not to be relaxed, and for good reason.
The reason is this. In rhythm, in sounds of the human
voice, timed to movements of the human body, mankind first
discovered that social consent which brought the great joys
and the great pains of life into a common utterance. The
mountain, so runs a Basque proverb, is not necessary to the
mountain, but man is necessary to man. Individual thinking,
a vast fermentation, centrifugal tendencies of every sort,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>have played upon this simple and primitive impulse; but the
poet is still essentially emotional, and just so far as he is to
utter the great joys and the great pains of life, just so far he
must go back to communal emotions, to the sense of kind, to
the social foundation.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c012'><sup>[249]</sup></a> The mere fact of utterance is social;
however solitary his thought, a poet’s utterance must voice
this consent of man with man, and his emotion must fall
into rhythm, the one and eternal expression of consent.
This, then, is why rhythm will not be banished from poetry
so long as poetry shall remain emotional utterance; for
rhythm is not only sign and warrant of a social contract
stronger, deeper, vaster, than any fancied by Rousseau, but
it is the expression of a human sense more keen even than
the fear of devils and the love of gods,—the sense and sympathy
of kind.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />THE TWO ELEMENTS IN POETRY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The study of rhythm threw one fact of primitive life into
very strong relief,—the predominance of masses of men over
individual effort,<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c012'><sup>[250]</sup></a> and the almost exclusive reign of communal
song as compared with poetry of the solitary artist, with that
poetry which nowadays makes sole claim to the title. Does
this point to a fundamental dualism? Are there two kinds
of poetry, communal and artistic; or must one say that the
choral throng and the reading public, the improvising singer
and the modern poet, are convertible terms, with refrains,
repetition, chorus, as a negligible quantity? Is the making
of poetry really one process under all conditions of production;
or does the main impulse, in itself everywhere invariable,
undergo enough change in its outward relations and
conditions to warrant the division of its product into two
kinds? Goethe is thought to have answered this question in
his discussion of certain Lithuanian popular songs, when he
wondered “that folk make so much of these ballads of the
people, and rate them so high. There is only one poetry,
the real and the true; all else is approximation and show.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Poetic talent is given to the peasant as well as to the knight;
it depends whether each lays hold upon his own condition
and treats it as it deserves, in which case the simplest relations
will be the best.” And there an end, cries the critic;
what more is to be said? Nothing, if one is discussing poetry
merely as an impulse to emotional expression which springs
simple and distinct from the heart of man. But there is
more to be said when one treats poetry not as the impulse,
but as the product of the impulse, a product falling into sundry
classes according to the conditions under which it is
produced. Setting theory aside, it is a fact that critics of
every sort have been fain to look upon the product of the
poetic impulse as something not simple, but twofold.</p>

<p class='c013'>As was the case with rhythm, where a tradition of the
priority of verse compared with prose led to extravagant
theories of early man as singing instead of talking, and realizing
generally the conditions of an Italian opera stage, so
with this dualism now in hand; extravagant theories of folk-made
epics and self-made songs, have brought it into a discredit
absolutely undeserved. In some form, to be sure, this
dualism of the poetic product pervades the whole course of
criticism, and varies from a vague, unstable distinction to a
definite and often extravagant claim of divided origins; its
differencing factor now sunders the two parts as by a chasm,
and now leaves them with only the faintest line between.
Always, however, this differencing factor is more than an
affair of words. It has nothing to do with classification of
materials or of form, as when Schleiermacher opposes the
epos and the drama as “plastic” to the purely lyric or “musical.”
It is not the dualism of high and low implied in Fontenelle’s
delightful “Description of the Empire of Poesy,”<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c012'><sup>[251]</sup></a>
with its highlands, including “that great city, epic,” and the
“lofty mountain of tragedy,” burlesque, however, in the lowlands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>and comedy, though a pleasant town, quite too close to
these marshes of farce to be safe. It is not the antithesis of
definition, not a mere exclusion,—poetry against science,
pleasure against truth, imaginative verse against unimaginative,
emotional against practical and didactic; not a separation
of cheap, shabby verses from the poetry which Ben
Jonson thought perfect, and fit to be seen “of none but grave
and consecrated eyes.” In a loose application, this twofold
character of the poetic product takes the form of an antithesis
between art and nature, a vague contrast, with terminology
yet more vague; and here, again, it is not the rival claims of
art and nature in any one piece,—whether</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Natura fieret laudabile carmen, an arte,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>or in any one man,—“the good poet’s made as well as
born”;<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c012'><sup>[252]</sup></a> but it is the contrast shown by poetry that is essentially
“natural” in origin, over against the rival sprung from
art. Often it is impartial: Jonson’s learned sock, or the wild
wood-notes of Shakspere,—“with Shakspere’s nature or
with Jonson’s art,” is Pope’s echo of Milton; but Milton’s
nephew, Phillips,<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c012'><sup>[253]</sup></a> pits “true native poetry” against “wit, ingenuity,
and learning in verse, even elegancy itself,”—Spenser
and Shakspere, that is, against his moderns. So one
comes by way of these great “natural” poets to the rural
muse herself, who has always been lauded and caressed
when eulogy was safe. If mediocrities are versing, “Tom
Piper makes us better melodie”; and this is Spenser’s honest
view, not his “ironicall sarcasmus.” Back to the shepherds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>says poetry, when it is tired of too much art; rustic and
homely and unlettered, is opposed to urban and lettered and
polite, song of the fields to verse that looks across an inkstand
at folios of the study. But this tendency in criticism to
rebuke poetry of the schools, its rouge and powder, by pointing
to the fresh cheeks of unspoiled rustic verse, is hardly to
the purpose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Passing from this loose and popular account of the dualism,
one finds the contrast, still mainly unhistorical, but stated
with precision, in the æsthetic realm. Schiller, one of the
masters in that school which combined metaphysical theory
with critical insight, divided poetry into the naive and the
sentimental; his famous essay, however, should be read along
with his poem on the <i>Künstler</i>, and with A. W. Schlegel’s
review of the poem; unsatisfactory as Schiller thought his
verse, it gives a historical comment on his theory, and he
used the idea of it for his Æsthetic Letters. It shows how
art,—thought and purpose, that is,—slowly took the place
of spontaneity, and so it gives a better because a historical
statement of the dualism in hand. Still, the phrase of naive
and sentimental passed into vogue; this is almost as much as
to say objective and subjective; and one knows what riot of
discussion followed. Ancient was set against modern, the
old dispute, realist against idealist, classic against romantic,
conservative against radical; add short and pithy phrases
from Goethe, dithyrambs on “om-mject and sum-mject”
from Coleridge; drop then, a nine days’ fall, to the minor
treatises in æsthetics: the thought of a century has been
ringing changes on this dualism. They are not to be noted
here, and are seldom to the purpose. Moses Mendelssohn’s
division into the “voluntary” and the “natural” looks at
first sight like an oracle from Herder; but it must be borne
in mind that Mendelssohn refused to regard as poetry those
waifs and strays of song which Herder praised. Masing, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>a dissertation<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c012'><sup>[254]</sup></a> of considerable merit, divides into poetry of
perception, which is rimeless, answering to the classical or the
objective, and poetry of feeling, which is rimed and includes
Christian, individual poetry: but there is no great gain in
this. Mr. E. C. Stedman<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c012'><sup>[255]</sup></a> thinks poetry is “differentiated
by the Me and the Not Me,” and thus he obtains his two main
divisions of the poetic product. So run some of the purely
theoretical contrasts; without stay in historic study, their
distinctions are based upon the poetic impulse, and there is
of course a far clearer case when one considers poetry in the
light of those conditions under which it is produced. Æsthetic
writers who apply the tests of sociology, for example,
have made a vast gain in their method of treatment and in
their results. Poetry to them is no vague, alien substance, a
planet to be watched through telescopes; it is an outcome of
the social life of man, and social facts must help to explain
it. Critic, historian, psychologist, all put new life into the
æsthetic discussion; and the artist himself is at hand.
Earlier than Taine, Hennequin, and Guyau, and along with
Sainte-Beuve, Richard Wagner,<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c012'><sup>[256]</sup></a> in a practical purpose, and
full of the ideas of 1848, tried to bring the conditions of
artistic production into line with the study of society. It is
not nature, he thinks, but the opposition to nature which has
brought forth art; man becomes independent of climate;
and social, human struggle is the making of this new man,
this “man independent of nature,” who alone called art into
being, and that not in tropical Asia, but “on the naked hillsides
of Greece.” Primitive man, dependent on nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>could never bring forth art, a social product made in the
teeth of adverse natural conditions.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c012'><sup>[257]</sup></a> Wagner, however,
goes further. Such is the history of art; but what of its
future? Art, literature, have become a solitary piece of
performance and of reception. The lonely modern man,
pining for poetic satisfaction, has but a sad and feeble comfort
in the poetry of letters. Back to social conditions, back
to the old trinity of song, movement, poem; back to the
<i>ensemble</i>, the folk-idea, the poetry of a people; let Shakspere
and Beethoven join hands in the art that is to be and
that must spring, as it once sprang, from no single individual
artist but from the folk!<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c012'><sup>[258]</sup></a> Dithyramb apart, here is a theory
of social origins with a definite though curious dualism of art
and nature; Wagner talks <i>Jacob-Grimmisch</i>, it is true, and
raves as Nietzsche raved afterward; but he has sociological
hints for which one searches the school of Grimm in vain.
Even in Victor Hugo’s fantastic but suggestive phrases,<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c012'><sup>[259]</sup></a> the
new science, the agitation of St. Simon and his school, may
perhaps be found; and there is no disguise of any sort in the
sociological æsthetics of Guyau,<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c012'><sup>[260]</sup></a> who repeats Hugo’s notion
in scientific terms, and so gives a precise expression to the
dualism once so vague. Primitive art, according to Guyau,
is a waking vision, and what we now call invention was at
first nothing but a spontaneous play of fancies and images
suggesting and following one another in the confusion of a
dream. Real art begins when this pastime comes to be work,
when thought and effort seize upon the play of fancy.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c012'><sup>[261]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>These were mainly critical and æsthetic views. Of greater
interest and importance is the dualism as it took shape under
the hands of that historical school which had the great democratic
movement in literature for its origin, Herder for its
prophet, and A. W. Schlegel for its high priest. Here the
dualism concerns not so much nature and art, uncertain terms
at best, but the body of people, the folk, the community,
nation, race, as contrasted with the individual artist, the
“man of letters.” It is poetry of the people over against
poetry of the schools. Conditions of this sort had been
noted by earlier writers of what one may call the scientific
bent, that is, by men like Scaliger, who in this respect was
following Aristotle; not, of course, by those who looked
upon the oldest poet as divine, a prophet and a seer, the
view taken by Platonists like Spenser<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c012'><sup>[262]</sup></a> and Sidney, by the
early renaissance, by Ronsard, and by belated followers of
Ronsard. He, for example, not only says that earliest poetry
was allegorical theology, to coax rough men into ideas of the
divine,<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c012'><sup>[263]</sup></a> but, in his preface about music,<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c012'><sup>[264]</sup></a> written for a collection
of songs and addressed to the king, he holds to the
idea of a spontaneous and sacred perfection in this primitive
verse. Later, so he explains in his Poetics, came “the
second class of poets, whom I call human, since they were
filled rather with artifice and labour than with divinity,”—nature
and art, again, in pious antithesis. It is different with
the scientific school. Scaliger, following Aristotle’s hints
about the origin of the drama, is for a normal process from
the natural to the artistic. Dante had made dualism a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>matter of rank, of merit, setting the <i>vulgare illustre</i> apart
from the <i>humile vulgare</i>, and bidding spontaneous, facile
poets beware how they undertake the things that belong to
art;<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c012'><sup>[265]</sup></a> Scaliger is not only historical but comparative, and in
the right fashion, assuming, at least for origins, no gradations
of rank. He is not for degeneration but for development;
instead of dividing the sheep from the goats, he regards
nature and art as two phases of the poetic conditions. Looking
at the three forms of primitive life,<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c012'><sup>[266]</sup></a> he gives the parentage
of verse to the pastoral; hunters were too mobile, and
ploughmen too busy, while shepherds had not only leisure for
meditation but the songs of birds as lure. In this earliest
stage Scaliger assumes two kinds of poetry, which he
calls the solitary and the social; and again in the second
division he makes a further contrast of the artless or natural,—not,
he warns his reader, not to be classed as vulgar,—and
the more artistic, such as those amœbean forms which
are found in later pastoral verse. In other words, Scaliger
hints at a fundamental dualism; and his account of the
matter, modern in spirit despite its conventional style and
its appeal to the ancients, is better than Herder’s cloudy
enthusiasm in all respects save one, and that, of course, an
exception of vast importance: Scaliger failed to put the
rustic and communal verse of Europe on a par with “natural”
and social songs of the prime.</p>

<p class='c013'>This distinction of art and nature as a theory of origins,
and with a touch of the historical method in its treatment,
is found again and again in treatises on poetry from the
renaissance to our own time.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c012'><sup>[267]</sup></a> It is by no means confined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>to the brilliant and epoch-making writers. Who was farther
removed from Herder, so far as notions about poetry are
concerned, than Gottsched? But Gottsched, dull dog, as
Dr. Johnson would have called him, makes a clear distinction
between natural and artistic verse;<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c012'><sup>[268]</sup></a> more than this,
he backs his theory of origins by referring to those “songs
of the hill folk,” heard in his own day, which still show
characteristics of primitive poetry. Earlier yet, in the
remarkable work of Morhof<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c012'><sup>[269]</sup></a> one finds use of the comparative
method and a keen sense of historic values; here is investigation,
not theory outright, as with the younger Racine,<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c012'><sup>[270]</sup></a> or mere
chronicle, as with M. de la Nauze.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c012'><sup>[271]</sup></a> It is curious, too, that
from the clergy came some of the most rationalistic accounts
of the dualism of nature and art, in opposition to the divine
and human idea of the renaissance. One must not forget
Herder’s cloth; Lowth took Hebrew poetry, as poetry, quite
out of the supernatural; and Calmet,<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c012'><sup>[272]</sup></a> whose work on the
Bible was once valued by scholars, comments at length on
the dualism as natural and artificial, not as human and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>divine. Improvisation seems to be his test for the natural
sort, submission to rules and deliberation, his test for artificial
verse; and in the first case it is wrath, joy, sorrow, hate,
love, some natural outburst of passion, which is poetry by
the mere fact of its utterance. Moreover, this poetry of
nature is found in every clime;<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c012'><sup>[273]</sup></a> and inseparable from it,
in early stages, is the natural music, song, which itself in
course of time must be tamed by art. Like Budde in our
own day, Calmet points out “natural” songs in the Bible.
It was left, however, for Herder to bring forward all natural,
artless poetry not as a regret but as a hope, or rather as a
disinherited exile come back to claim his own; how the
German pleaded for his client, and with what success, is
matter of common fame. At the historical school of which
he is the conspicuous exponent in matters of poetry we
must give a closer look.</p>

<p class='c013'>Herder, in point of fact, was before a larger tribunal than
that of poetry, and in his plea for communal verse he was joining
the great democratic movement which ran through European
thought at large, no less active because less conspicuous
in science, art, letters, religion, than in affairs of state. A passion
for democracy had gone from literature into politics and
again from politics into literature, begetting this notion of creative
power in the people as a whole; about the time that philosophers
discovered the people in politics, Hamann and
Herder discovered the folk in verse. The earlier eighteenth
century, like all the preceding Christian centuries from the
time of St. Augustine,<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c012'><sup>[274]</sup></a> when saint or prophet or king was the
embodiment of progress, still turned history into biography,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>and human development into a series of individual inventions;
any movement in social life, whether of war or of peace, was
due to the great man,—general, king, orator, poet,—who
began or led the movement. Pascal’s pleasantry about Cleopatra
and her nose became a serious system of history and
philosophy. Even as late as Turgot,<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c012'><sup>[275]</sup></a> for example, one pinned
one’s faith to great men, to genius, for the advancement of
mankind. The seventeenth century had asked for <i>raison</i>;
the eighteenth sought <i>esprit</i>.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c012'><sup>[276]</sup></a> Genius was already a watchword
when the democratic movement began, and it was not
discarded by the new school; the Rousseaus and Herders
clung to genius, but with a new interpretation of the word,
and added that larger idea of “nature.” Critics are apt to
forget that the return to nature was preceded by a return to
genius. The next step was to substitute natural genius for
the great man, to separate genius from the individual; and
here the democratic movement found help at hand in the
progress and gains of science. Science was now clear of the
church, and began to work into the domain of law, causes,
force; it sought the impersonal both in natural and in supernatural
things. Cold and analytic in the earlier decades, science
in the later eighteenth century grew emotional, synthetic,
romantic, and full of zeal for what the Germans call “combination.”
What a change from the earlier mood, represented,
one might say, in Shaftesbury’s letter on enthusiasm! “Good
humour,” he writes in 1707,<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c012'><sup>[277]</sup></a> “is not only the best security
against enthusiasm, but the best foundation of piety and true
religion.” Even as late as 1766, when the spirit of enthusiasm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>was again abroad, aristocratic Horace Walpole sounds
the old note against the new communalism in his account
of a sermon which he heard Wesley preach at Bath; the
preacher “exalted his voice, and <i>acted very ugly enthusiasm</i>.”
Enthusiasm, however, was now rife in science itself; still
blocked on the theological side, it turned to nature and
what lay undiscovered in her domain. No talk as yet of
a struggle for existence, no distinct lapse of faith in humanity
as main object of cosmic solicitudes; but a disposition
to find in the sweep and conflict of natural forces sufficiently
good answer to any question about the history of man,
and a tendency to force upon individual men a transfer of
values to the race. Not the individual, but the mass, and
behind this mass the currents of life at large, were to interpret
history. The great man disappeared, or else served
simply as mouthpiece for the national and popular genius;
and it was at this point that Herder appeared with his <i>Thoughts
for the Philosophy of the History of Mankind</i>,—thoughts
that here and there foreshadow the doctrine of evolution.
Down to the extreme theories of Buckle, this point of view
was taken by historians and philosophers. True, much is
said of the individual; Rousseau, Goethe in his <i>Werther</i>,
Herder, even, and Hamann, all glorified the free, individual
man; it is not individual man in the old sense, however, but
rather man himself as type of the human brotherhood, as one
of a throng, the “citizen” whether high or low. More than
this, it was a glorification of primitive man himself without
the differencing and individualizing work of culture; the eighteenth
century, and not merely in Rousseau’s sentimental
fashion, discovered the savage on one side, and, on the other
side, unspoiled men of the prime. In literature there was an
outbreak of gentle savages and a very mob of Robinson Crusoes;
while for philosophy and science, the alchemy of human
perfectibility, a desire to reconstruct society by the elixir of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>primitive life and a study of man as he ought to be, preceded
the chemistry of modern anthropological and sociological
researches, which aim at an analysis of earliest social conditions
and the science of man both as he was and as he is.</p>

<p class='c013'>This democratic thought of the eighteenth century had an
outer and an inner circle, answering in great measure to the
notion of humanity and the notion of the people or “folk.”
It was Vico who put men upon the first trail, who reformed
scientific methods, and who, with all his antiquated theories,
is often so surprisingly modern. He bade men look for the
mind of humanity, the soul of it, as revealed in history, poetry,
law, language, religion. He traced something of the inner
circle as well, tossing aside Homer’s personality, and saying
that Homer was the Greek people itself as it told the story
of its deeds. He set up the antithesis between imagination
and reason, and gave the formula of culture as a decrease of
the one and an increase of the other. Herder said these
things seventy years later, and indeed his mere plea for
humanity and nationality<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c012'><sup>[278]</sup></a> adds little to the ideas of Vico;
what the German added of his own was on the larger scale
a substitution of people for race, and on the smaller scale a
plea for the actual folk about one, the community of rustics,
the village throng, not idealized shepherds and subjects of
the Saturnian reign. From Vico to Herder, then, democracy
was in the air, pervading the rationalism that so easily turned
into sentiment and the naturalism that so readily fabled a
new supernaturalism. Particularly in its theories of poetry
the eighteenth century responded to the democratic impulse
along three lines, the scientific, the historical, and what one
would now call the ethnological and sociological.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c012'><sup>[279]</sup></a> A detailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>account of these three currents of thought in their effect upon
the study of poetry would be of interest and profit in the
present work, but demands too much space; it must be
reserved for separate treatment. We must confine our attention
to the movement for communal or popular verse, and
even that must be described in merest outline.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first man in Europe to recognize poetry of the people,
and to make it a term of the dualism now in hand, was Montaigne.
He discovered the thing and gave a name to it,—<i>la
poésie populaire</i>; he praised it for its power and grace; and
he brought it into line with that poetry of savages then first
coming into the view of European critics. The specimen
which he gave of this savage verse remained for a long time
the only one commonly known in Europe; in like manner,
a Lapland <i>Lament</i>, published in Scheffer’s Latin, came to
be the conventional specimen of lowly or popular song.
Montaigne, however, spoke boldly for the critical value of
both kinds, savage and popular, bidding them hold up their
heads in the presence of art. He praises the two extremes
of poetic development, nature and simplicity on the one
hand, and, on the other, noble artistic effort; for what Cotton
translates as “the mongrets” he has open scorn.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c012'><sup>[280]</sup></a> Along
with the savage verses which he quotes in another essay<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c012'><sup>[281]</sup></a>
he makes shrewd comments on the refrain and the dancing,
shows an interest in ethnology, and even names his
authorities,—“a man in my house who lived ten or twelve
years in the New World,” and in smaller degree natives to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>whom he talked at Rouen. Now this insight, this outlook, of
Montaigne are unique. Sidney, whom a German scholar<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c012'><sup>[282]</sup></a>
praises for catholicity of taste equal to that of Montaigne
and not derived from him, is too academic; he notes the
<i>areytos</i> of America, by way of proof that rudest nations have
poetry, and bursts out in that praise of “the old song of
Percy and Douglas,” only to take away from its critical value
by a limitation quite foreign to the spirit of Montaigne.
Neither Sidney nor Puttenham,<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c012'><sup>[283]</sup></a> in their notice of savage and
of communal poetry, came anywhere near the Frenchman’s
point of view.</p>

<p class='c013'>The catholicity and discernment of Montaigne, the careless
approval of Sidney, the comparative vein in Puttenham, had
really no following in Europe until Herder’s time. Poetry
of the people remained a literary outcast; and as late as
1775 a German professor “would have felt insulted by the
mere idea of any attention” to such verse.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c012'><sup>[284]</sup></a> Englishmen, to
be sure, began long before this to collect the ballads, to print
them, and even to write about them in a shamefaced way;
but this was eccentricity of the kind for which, according
to Matthew Arnold, continental folk still make allowance.
Ambrose Phillips, or whoever made the collection begun in
1723, is very bold in his first volume; he “will enter upon the
praise of ballads and shew their antiquity;” in the second
volume he weakens, and will “say as little upon the subject
as possibly” he can; while in the third volume he actually
apologizes for the “ludicrous manner” in which he wrote the
two other prefaces. He had suggested that the ballads were
really “written by the greatest and most polite wits of their
age”; but nobody in England paid much heed to the subject
of origins, barring a little powder burnt over the thing by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Percy and Ritson; and the making of a theory, the founding
of ballad criticism and research as a literary discipline, was
left to German pens.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been said that Herder was the prophet of the faith
in communal poetry. Herder’s “origins,” so far as this doctrine
is concerned, are interesting enough. That the individual
is child of his time, child of his race, child of his soil;
that he is not only what “suns and winds and waters” make
him, but what long ages and vast conspiracies of nature and
the sum of human struggle have made him,—strand by strand
of this cord can be brought from Hamann, from Blackwell,
Lowth, Robert Wood, Hurd, Spence, from Condorcet, Montesquieu,
Rousseau; but all that does not make up Herder. It
was his grasp of this entire evolutionary process, his belief in
it, his fiery exhortation, in a word, his genius, that made him
the only begetter of the modern science. Full of scorn for
closet verse of his day, he held up the racial or national,
the “popular” in its best sense, against the pedantic and
the laboured,—poetry that beats with the pulse of a whole
people against poetry that copies its exercises from a dead
page and has no sense of race. He sundered poetry for the
ear from poetry for the eye, poetry said or sung from poetry
that looks to “a paper eternity” for its reward. Under his
hands, in a word, the dualism became real, a state of things
impossible while one was juggling with an adjective like
“natural” or with a phrase like “naive and sentimental.”
He gathered and printed songs of the folk, as he calls them,
or by another title, voices of the nations.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c012'><sup>[285]</sup></a> Here, of course, is
lack of precision; a peasant’s song and a soliloquy of Hamlet,
one because really “popular,” the other because really
“national,” are ranged alike as folksongs. But the dualism
stands. Oral, traditional, communal poetry, and whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>springs from these, are set clearly against poetry of the schools.
Naturally, Herder was unjust to the cause of art, or rather he
seems to be unjust. What he does is to bid the artist stand
for a community or race and reflect their life, or else fall, a
negligible and detached thing. Poetry is a spring of water
from the living rock of community or nation; whether Moses,
Homer, Shakspere, dealt the unsealing blow, or whether the
waters gushed out of their own force, Herder cared not a
whit.</p>

<p class='c013'>This doctrine of a dualism in poetry was still further
elaborated by A. W. Schlegel, who brought to the task not
only his unerring literary tact,<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c012'><sup>[286]</sup></a> his critical insight, his astounding
sympathy for foreign literatures, but his method of historical
and genetic research. In his early essay on Dante,
he broke away from the method then in vogue, and used historical
tests instead of that philosophical analysis so dear to
Schiller. No one has stated the dualism of communal and
artistic poetry so clearly as Schlegel has done;<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c012'><sup>[287]</sup></a> and yet,
owing to a curious lack of perspective in modern criticism, he
is credited with the achievement of crushing the dualism to
naught. Leaving the details to another occasion, we may
give a brief outline of this case, which has so distinct a bearing
on the question of poetical origins. In his lectures and
in sundry essays, Schlegel states the historical dualism, and
repeats Aristotle’s account of early communal and improvised
verse, adding, however, what Aristotle refused to give, recognition
of this as poetry and respect for its rude nobility of
style. As Schlegel left the matter in his lectures, there was
nothing to which one could raise an objection; and the same
is true of a temperate statement, made by Wilhelm von Humboldt,<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c012'><sup>[288]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>which may be quoted here at length. “In the course
of human development,” he says, “there arise two distinct
kinds of poetry, marked respectively by the presence and
the absence of written records. One, the earlier, may be
called natural poetry; it springs from an enthusiasm which
lacks the purpose and consciousness of art. The second is a
later product, and is full of art; but it is none the less outcome
of the deepest and purest spirit of poetry.” One sees
it is not the communal bantling that has to be praised
and defended here; not rude, uncivil verse that once found
an advocate in Herder, but now needs no advocate; it is the
poetry of art that must be lauded and protected as even-christian
with “natural” verse. Democratic ideas had put
the poetry of nature above all else; the pantheistic doctrines
of Schelling, carrying even Schlegel off his feet, had made a
school for the universal, general, communal, absolute, in
verse; and a wholesome reaction had set in. Humboldt’s
modest words could have been signed by nearly every critical
warrior, Trojan or Tyrian, who took up his pen in the long
dispute; the trouble had begun when scholars tried to give
details about the origin of natural or popular verse and
essayed to draw close lines of definition between the people
and the artist. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, full of romance,
piety, and pantheism, laid stress upon this kindly word
“natural” and dogmatized it into a creed.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c012'><sup>[289]</sup></a> A song sings
itself; a “folk” can be poet; nations make their own epic;
the process is a mystery: these and like phrases are now
regarded by short-sighted critics as a fair summary of the
democratic or communal doctrine of poetry, and are thought
to have been blown into space, along with the doctrine, by a
clumsy jest of Scherer about the Pentecost. Scherer, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>has given a history of this movement, with what seems to
him a closing of the account, in his admirable book on Jacob
Grimm; but neither this nor his jest can be regarded as final.
He appeals to Schlegel as the great literary critic who really
killed this doctrine of the folk in verse as soon as it was born,
although the great reputation of the Grimms gave it an appearance
of life and vigour down to the time say ... of Scherer.
Now it is a fact, overlooked by German scholars, that A. W.
Schlegel laid down a theory of communal origins, almost
identical with that of the Grimms, at a time when Jacob was
barely fifteen and Wilhelm fourteen years old. In an essay
on Bürger,<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c012'><sup>[290]</sup></a> whom he loved and admired, Schlegel asks
whether this man of genius was really what he thought he
was, a poet of the folk, and whether his poetry could be
called poetry of the people. To answer the question,
Schlegel makes a study of old ballads, and says that these
were not purposely made for the folk, but were composed
among the people,—“<i>composed, in a manner of speaking,
by the folk itself as a whole</i>.”<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c012'><sup>[291]</sup></a> This community which
made the old ballads was of course homogeneous; the
style of them is without art or rhetoric; they come spontaneously.
In short, “the free poetic impulse did that
with ease and success to which the careful artist now purposely returns.”
Here is the later doctrine of Jacob and
Wilhelm Grimm in a nutshell; how much of it did Schlegel
reject fifteen years later in that famous criticism<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c012'><sup>[292]</sup></a> of the
Grimms’ <i>Old German Forests</i>, where he turns state’s evidence
against his fellow conspirators for demos? Simply its
extravagances, but by no means its reiteration of a dualism
in the poetic product springing from conditions of production.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>That idea stands intact; for all of Schlegel’s historical
studies are based upon it. Moreover, the Grimms said far
more than Schlegel had said, and went into deeper extravagances
of romance. He denied their assumption that the great
mass of legend, song, epic, which one finds or surmises at the
beginnings of a national literature, is the authoritative and
essentially true deliverance of the nation itself. Nor is there
a pious mystery—and here Schlegel touches the quick—in
the making of such songs. A poem implies a poet. In
brief, the Grimms were not to furbish up the idyll of a golden
age, bind it in a mystery, and hand it over to the public as
an outcome of exact philological studies. This process, he
said in sum, is all theory and no fact; and here lies the
stress of Schlegel’s criticism, which really involved only a
partial and superficial recanting of his own doctrine. He
was always wont to turn from theory to fact, and in the
Grimms’ wild theory he found no facts at all; he protests
against the self-made song, the folk-made song even; but he
would have been the first to give ear to any plea for a difference
between songs of art and songs of the people that was
based on facts and that might bring out those social conditions
which determine the poem as it is made. He had himself
repeatedly brought out these conditions, these facts, and he
nowhere recants the doctrine which he founded on them.
He unsays, perhaps without consciousness of any change of
opinion, his old saying about the folk as a poet; he does not
unsay his belief in the dualism of poetry according to the
conditions under which it is produced. “All poetry,” he declares,
“rests on a union of nature and art; without art it
can get no permanent form, without nature its vitality is gone.”
True; but there is communal art and there is individual art, or
rather there are two kinds of poetry according as art and the
individual or instinct and the community predominate; and
this dualism he had repeatedly affirmed, just as Aristotle had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>hinted it long before him. Schlegel does not reduce it to a
mere matter of record,<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c012'><sup>[293]</sup></a> as modern critics do when they seize
upon Humboldt’s saying that the difference between oral and
written is the “mark” of the dualism—he does not say its
essence; for it is treated, even in this critical essay, as a
matter of conditions of production. The scholar who took
up poetry on the genetic and historical side, who followed
brutish and uncivil man slowly tottering into the path of art,
is not lost in the critic who simply refuses to see primitive
poetry bursting by miracle out of a whole nation into an Iliad,
a Nibelungen Lay, a Beowulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>This, then, is particularly to be borne in mind; the dualism
of the poetic product based on the difference between
communal and individual conditions of production does not
rise and fall with the dualism as it took shape in the theory
of the Grimms.<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c012'><sup>[294]</sup></a> Aristotle had set aside all unpremeditated,
artless verse of the throng, and had regarded it at best as
mere foundation, no part of the poetic structure. Jacob
Grimm went to the other extreme, and set off from poetry
all laboured, premeditated, individual verse; he accepted
modern poetry, to be sure, but explained away the poet;
the superstructure was nothing save as it implied that unseen
foundation. Or, to put it in different phrase, the old
doctrine of imitation as mainspring of poetry had yielded to
the idea of a power, an informing energy; one turned, like
Addison, to the imaginative process, or else to deeper
sources. Herder told men to seek this source, this poetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>power, in the people, with their primitive passions and their
unspoiled utterance. Herder was general, often merely negative,
and exhorted; the Grimms were positive and dogmatized,
teaching that the whole people as a whole people once
made poetry. But this extravagance must not drag down in
its death those sober facts about which criticism has always
hovered with its hints or statements of the twofold nature of
poetry. Moreover, just as these facts are to be held in plain
view, and not lost in the haze of an impossible theory, so, too,
they are not to be rationalized and explained away into a
facile, unmeaning phrase about the difference between oral
and written record. It is a question of the difference in
poetic production due to varying conditions under which the
poetic impulse has to work; and some difference of this sort,
not of mere record, is recognized in the whole range of criticism,
mostly, however, by expressions about art and nature
which leave much to be desired in the way of precise statement.
Nature and art are terms of æsthetics; even when
used in a more or less historical sense, the historical comprehension
of them is uncertain; can they not be transferred
then, to terms of sociology, of ethnology, of literary conditions,
so as to correspond with the actual facts of poetry and
with the actual history of man,—transferred in good faith,
and for the interests of no theory, but to provide clear tests
for an investigation which studies communal poetry in order
to determine whether it can throw light upon the conditions
of primitive song? There is certainly such a dualism of
conditions apart from the record. Even the most intrepid
monist allows the dualism of the term “mankind” according
as one takes man social or man individual, the solitary man
of reflection, ethics, judgment, and the same man as one of a
crowd of madmen—mad for the nonce, mad gregariously,
but mad. M. Tarde has recently drawn this picture in very
bold outlines. There are two men in the juryman,—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>individual and the juryman. Does this, then, hold in poetry?
It is a fact that poetry made by a throng, or made in a
throng, or made for a throng, or made in whatever fashion
but finding its way, as favourite expression, to a throng—and
every theory of communal verse may be referred to one
of these cases—is a quite distinct kind of poetry from that
which is made by the solitary poet for the solitary reader.
Nowadays nearly all poetry is written and read, but once
upon a time nearly all poetry was sung and heard; a very
hasty glance at this antithesis will show that it concerns production
at least as much as it concerns the record. It serves
as basis for the division of poetry into one class where the
communal spirit and environment condition the actual making,
and into another class where the artist, the individual,
has upper hand from the start.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c012'><sup>[295]</sup></a> It sets primitive poetry, at
least in some important characteristics, over against the poetry
of modern times. If, then, communal poetry still exists
in survival; if the sense of literary evolution, the facts of literary
evolution, the facts of ethnology, the conclusions of
sociology, all assert that primitive poetry was communal
rather than individual in the conditions of its making; then
it is clear that a study of the survivals ought to be one of the
best ways by which one could come to reasonably sure conclusions
about poetry of the prime.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />THE DIFFERENCING ELEMENTS OF THE POETRY OF ART</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Nobody will deny that the modern man does more thinking
and less singing than the man, say, of Shakspere’s
time; and nobody will deny that thinking needs solitude,
while singing—real, hearty singing—asks the throng and a
refrain. Thought, M. Anatole France<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c012'><sup>[296]</sup></a> declares in his vivacious
way, “thought is the acid which dissolves the universe,
and if all men fell to thinking at once, the world would cease
to be.” “Lonely thinking,” says Nietzsche, “that is wise;
lonely singing,—stupid.” In the same fashion, a solitary
habit of thinking has made itself master of poetry, particularly
of the lyric; while the singing of a poem is going fast
out of date. Poetry begins with the impersonal, with communal
emotion, and passes to a personal note of thought
so acutely individual that it has to disguise itself, wear
masks, and prate about being objective. For objective and
even simple poetry may be highly subjective at heart; and
to define subjective as talking about one’s self, what Bagehot,
in his essay on Hartley Coleridge, calls self-delineation, is
by no means a sufficient account of the trait. When the
folksong runs:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A Nant’s, à Nant’s est arrivé,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Saute, blonde, et lève le pied</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Trois beaux navir’s chargés de blé;</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Saute, blonde, ma joli’ blonde</i>....</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>and Béranger sings:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Une plainte touchante</div>
      <div class='line'>De ma bouche sortit;</div>
      <div class='line'>Le bon Dieu me dit, Chante,</div>
      <div class='line'>Chante, pauvre petit!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>it is not only wrong to take simplicity as the differencing
factor of the communal song, for Béranger is quite as simple,
but it will not do to fall back on mere self-delineation as end
of the matter in art. Half of the folksongs of Europe are
self-delineations of the singing and dancing crowd, in mass
or by deputed “I.” The real difference lies in the shifting
of the point of view; song, once the consolation and expression
of the festal crowd, comes to be the consolation and
expression of the solitary poet. “I do not inquire,” Ribot
remarks,<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c012'><sup>[297]</sup></a> “whether this sort of isolation in an ivory tower
is a gain or a loss for poetry; but I observe its growing
frequency as civilization advances, the complete antithesis
to its collective character in the earliest ages.” To study
such a change in the long reaches of poetic progress would
be an almost impossible task even if the material were at
hand; it is best to take a comparatively short range of time
and a definite place,—say the literature of modern Europe
from its beginning in the Middle Ages down to the present
time. The extremes are fairly sundered. Europe had lapsed
from civilization to a half barbarous state, from the height
of the Roman empire to the depth of the dark ages, with a
corresponding decline of intellectual power and a great
inrush of communal force. Out of these communal conditions,
individual and intellectual vigour made its difficult
way; how difficult, how tortuous that way, every one knows;
and it is along this route, and about the time of the renaissance,
that one may best watch the differencing elements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>of artistic and individual poetry as they come slowly into
view.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the individual<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c012'><sup>[298]</sup></a> frees himself from the clogs of his
mediæval guild, in literature as in life, there begins the distinctly
modern idea of fame, of glory, as a personal achievement
apart from community or state; and there, too, begins
the idea of literary property. Fame of the poet had its
classical tradition, and was asserted in a conventional, meaningless
way by mediæval poets, chiefly in Latin; but the
market value of a poem is something new.<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c012'><sup>[299]</sup></a> From this time
on there is a pathetic struggle in the poet’s mind whether
he shall regard his poem as offspring to cherish or as ware
to sell. Randolph, writing to his friend, Master Anthony
Stafford, takes the nobler view:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Let clowns get wealth and heirs: when I am gone ...</div>
      <div class='line'>If I a poem leave, that poem is my son.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is pretty antithesis, too, between the director and the
poet in Goethe’s play before the play in <i>Faust</i>,—one for
his box-receipts, and the other for the solitudes of poetry and
the gods. A happy solution has been found of late for this
dilemma; over the naked contradiction of love and merchandise
one throws the cloak of the artist. The artist begets
in pure love of his art; and he sells for Falstaff’s reason,—it
is his vocation. Until poetry got this market value, however,
it was common goods; poets had written generically,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>as members of a class or guild,<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c012'><sup>[300]</sup></a> and any member might use
the common stock of expressions and ideas. A translator
was as great as his original.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c012'><sup>[301]</sup></a> The eighth chapter of Dante’s
essay on composition in the vernacular opens with a curious
discourse about artistic property, as if the new idea and the
new phrase needed a gloss. “When we say, ‘this is Peter’s
<i>canzone</i>,’ we mean that Peter made it, not merely that he
uttered it!” Such an explanation, however, seems timely
enough if one remembers that “a mediæval writer held it
to be improper to join his name to any literary composition,”<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c012'><sup>[302]</sup></a>
and that Dante, “first of the moderns” as he is, and personal
as his work seems to be, actually names himself but
once in the whole <i>Commedia</i>. Here is the dying struggle
of that clan ownership<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c012'><sup>[303]</sup></a> which had ruled from the days of
the primitive horde; for it is clear that intellectual property
would be the last kind to be developed, and even if the poet
liked to see his name graven on the colder side of the rock,
this was not an isolated, personal distinction, but was merged
in the register of the guild like the names on a soldiers’
monument. Horace’s “write me down among the lyric
poets” was an intelligible ambition to mediæval minds; but
the purely personal triumph of his <i>non omnis móriar</i> and its
splendid context was alien to their way of thought. Barring
the degree of genius in each, one may say that Dante and
Victor Hugo were equally strong in their intense individuality;
here is a case where Gautier’s phrase holds good that
the brain of an artist was the same under the Pharaohs as
it is now; yet that conditions change the product, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>individual note, piercing in the modern, becomes almost
communal and generic in the older poet, that a distinct curve
of evolution to the personal extreme, even in artistic poetry,
can be drawn between them, is clear to probation for any
one who will compare two famous passages which a hasty
inference would probably declare to be on the same straight
individual line. If one looks at the whole passage where
Dante speaks of his poetic achievement,<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c012'><sup>[304]</sup></a> and if one neither
isolates a phrase nor yet sentimentalizes it all to suit modern
ideas; if one notes the satisfaction which the poet feels with
his work in and for the guild, and how he passes the time
of day with a brother craftsman; then one will find in it
not only a touch of artlessness, of what is called, rightly or
wrongly, the mediæval, the communal, but an effacement
of personality in the very act of asserting it. He shows,
as it were, his diploma from the guild of poets. To bring
this artlessness into clear relief, one has only to compare the
thirty-second of Hugo’s <i>Chants du Crépuscule</i>, where the poet,
alone in an old tower, addresses the bell which hangs there,
its pious inscription insulted by the obscenities, blasphemies,
and futilities written over it; he is no exile, this poet, but
proudly and contemptuously isolated from his kind, whose
brutishness he has just deplored; and he speaks thus to the
bell,—of all survivals the most characteristic of mediæval
thought, the veriest symbol of communal religious life:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sens-tu, par cette instinct vague et plein de douceur,</div>
      <div class='line'>Qui révèle toujours une sœur à la sœur,</div>
      <div class='line'>Qu’à cette heure où s’endort la soirée expirante,<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c012'><sup>[305]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span><i>Une âme est près de toi, non moins que toi vibrante</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Qui bien souvent aussi jette un bruit solennel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Et se plaint dans l’amour comme toi dans le ciel?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Then the superb lines of comparison: life has written on
the poet’s soul base and irreverent inscriptions, like those on
the bell; but a touch of the divine, a message, and like the
bell, so his soul breaks out into harmonies in which even the
audacities and futilities perforce take part. Compare all this
introspection, this immense assumption of individual importance,
with the objective, communal tone of Dante, despite
that “I am one who sings whenever love inspires me,”—so
like Hugo’s assertion, and yet so different. In each of these
passages one can see artistic individuality; but between them
stretches a long chain of development in which each link is
a new emphasis on the individual in art. One of the earliest
and strongest of these links was forged by the renaissance;
although it must be borne in mind that Dante represents not
simply his guild of singers, but behind them a singing community
of peasants, the songs of field, spinning-room, and
village dance, still dominant among unlettered folk and not
yet shamed into silence by print and the schoolmaster.</p>

<p class='c013'>The change, however, was there; the tide had turned
against communal sentiment, and individuals were feeling a
new power. Not only fame and glory fled from the guild to
the great man; individual disgrace, the lapse, the shortcoming,
find a record. Once the flyting was carried out before
the folk, rose and fell with the occasion, and was a thing of
festal origin, like the Eskimo poem-duel, or the earliest amœbean
verse, or the German <i>schnaderhüpfl</i>; but Aretino now
appears as the father of journalism in our pleasant modern
sense, as the arch reporter, the discoverer and publisher of
personal scandal.<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c012'><sup>[306]</sup></a> In painting, too, one notes the sudden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>rage for portraits; and it is the portrait of the individual for
himself, not simply of pope, or of abbot, or of prince, as the
head and type of a corporation, although a trace of this influence lingers
in the setting of the picture, witness one of
Holbein’s merchants, with his bills, pens, memoranda, and a
dozen mercantile suggestions scattered about him. Poetry, of
course, felt the change first of all, both in subject-matter and
in form. For the latter, there is the founding of the sonnet,
that apartment for a single gentleman in verse. One thinks
at once of Petrarch, rightly called “the first modern man,”
and deserving the title better than Dante, who was quite as
mediæval as he was modern,<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c012'><sup>[307]</sup></a> while Petrarch belonged to the
new world; besides his sonnets, his correspondence and his
confessions show that he not only felt the need, as none of his
predecessors had felt it, to reveal and analyze his personality,
but also recognized an interest on the part of the public
to which these revelations could respond. The mediæval
poet sought his public, did not call the public to himself;
and the artistic form of his poetry is the utterance of common
feeling in a common and often conventional phrase.
The May morning, the vision,<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c012'><sup>[308]</sup></a> the garden and the roses and
the blindingly beautiful young person, the allegorical birds
and beasts,—this was the late mediæval tether; although
allegory helped the poet to escape the throng and hedge his
personality with some importance, even allegory is in the
service if not of the throng, at least of the guild. Allegory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>as a poetical form mediates between the old communal ballad,
or the <i>chanson de geste</i>, and the new lyric of confidences.
The modern poet cut loose from it all, and cast about for the
gentle reader, soon to be his portion by the happy intervention
of print. Ronsard strikes this note of separation from
an unappreciative throng, and so does many another humanist;
while Chaucer’s contempt for the masses is not so much
artistic as mediæval and aristocratic. Dunbar, our first really
modern poet, the first to take that purely individual attitude,
was also first of our poets to see his work in printer’s ink.
Even when the form of literature demanded objective treatment,
the interest began to be individual. We now laud our
poet or playwright for the fine individuality of his folk, and
flout those masterless tales, songs, ballads, where even the
hero is a mere type, or, worse, a mere doer of deeds. This
doer of deeds answered the desire for poetic expression at a
time when an individual was merged in his clan; the excess
of interest in action is proportioned to the excess of communal
over individual importance. As the artist develops,
as he begins to feel his way toward individualism, his genius
is spent first upon allegory, and then, as real life grows more
imperious, upon the type, a compromise between individual
and community. Here stands Chaucer. Like Dante he
looks both ways; his squire, for example, deliciously clear
and individual as he seems, has as much reminiscence of
Childe Waters as prophecy of Romeo. It is characteristic of
the two periods in which Chaucer and Shakspere respectively
worked, that while one named his masterpiece, the study of
a vulgar woman, “a wife of Bath,” the other called a like
masterpiece “Mrs. Quickly of Eastcheap,”—a very pretty
little curve of evolution in itself; and when the portrait of
the merchant is drawn,—and what a portrait!—that careless
“sooth to sayn, I noot how men hym calle,” as compared
with Shakspere’s treatment of Antonio, is suggestive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>not only of the aristocrat, but also of the mediæval point of
view. Even the setting of the Prologue is in point,—these
pilgrims, each a representative of his class or corporation,
their common lodging, their association, even if temporary, as
in a guild, their jests, courtesies, and quarrels, all in the open
air. A century later, people had come indoors. Professor
Patten,<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c012'><sup>[309]</sup></a> alert to note the connection between æsthetic change
and a change in economic conditions, points out the alteration
thus wrought in the passage from communal to individual
life. Window-glass, the chimney, bricks, all improvements
of the home, changed this home from a prison to a
palace, from something shunned and undesired to the focal
point of happiness. Outdoor communal amusements yielded
to indoor pleasures shared by a few. The dances and the
license of May-day, uproarious and often questionable rejoicings
once common to all, were now left to the baser
sort, while quiet, reputable folk turned to their homes.
Knight and prioress, too, no longer rode beside the miller
and put up with his <i>gros rire</i>, his drunken antics, and his
tale.</p>

<p class='c013'>The main expression in poetry brought about by that new
power of the individual is the confidential note, the assumption
of a reader’s interest in the poet’s experience, what J. A.
Symonds called “the lyric cry,” begetting on the part of this
reader or hearer a sense at first confined to such mutual relations
of the poet and the sympathetic soul to which he spoke,
but spreading little by little until it is now fairly to be called
the medium, the atmosphere, of poetry at large; one names
it sentiment. The history of modern verse, with epic and
drama in decay, is mainly the history of lyrical sentiment.
Where does this first appear in European poetry?<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c012'><sup>[310]</sup></a> Answers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>to such a question are made with melancholy forebodings,
seeing that a first appearance in literary annals is as unstable
as the positively last appearance of a favourite singer; but
French criticism has pitched, with considerable show of right,
upon that amiable vagabond, Villon. Certainly the <i>Grand
Testament</i> is as familiar in its tone to the modern reader as it
is difficult and obsolete in its speech; and Sainte-Beuve, in a
pretty bit of criticism, has undertaken to show why Villon’s
most famous ballade touches this modern sense, while verses
seemingly like it are scorned as monkish prattle.<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c012'><sup>[311]</sup></a> Throughout
the Middle Ages a favourite form of communal sentiment,
or rather of theological and professional reflection, was to
ask where this and that famous person might now be found.
The mediæval poet could string together interminable rimed
queries like these of St. Bernard:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Dic ubi Salomon, olim tam nobilis?</div>
      <div class='line'>Vel ubi Samson est, dux invincibilis?</div>
      <div class='line'>Vel pulcher Absolon, vultu mirabilis?</div>
      <div class='line'>Vel dulcis Jonathas, multum amabilis?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and so on, with pagans like Cæsar, Tully, Aristotle. A
capable Frenchman traced this sort of poem far back, and
on his heels came a tireless, not to say superfluous, German;<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c012'><sup>[312]</sup></a>
but it was Sainte-Beuve who did the one important thing.
He sees in Villon’s queries about those fair ladies dead and
gone little more than the old conventional question, and finds
Villon’s originality in the exquisite refrain, with its light, half-mocking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>pathos: <i>But where are the snows of yester year?</i>
The Latin simply failed to add:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ast ubi nix vetus, tam effusibilis?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Yet Sainte-Beuve did not quite touch the quick. Even this
refrain is no more original than the queries; for it not only
echoes a popular phrase, and perhaps is itself nothing more
than a communal refrain,<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c012'><sup>[313]</sup></a> but it continues a theme of the
mediæval poet even better known than the <i>ubi sunt</i>. The
real change is not in words or phrase, but in a shifting from
the professional to the personal point of view. The poet of
the sacred guild could put this fact of mortality either as a
question or as an “example,”—witness a thirteenth-century
poem,<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c012'><sup>[314]</sup></a> where the prospect of dissolution is fortified by the
roasting of St. Lawrence, the beheading of John the Baptist,
and the stabbing of Thomas à Becket; while the same manuscript
which holds this “example” has a charming little
poem of questions, the <i>Luve Ron</i> of Thomas de Hales,
often quoted as forerunner of Villon’s ballade. “A maid
of Christ,”—and we note this touch of the guild,—“asks
me to make her a love-song. I will do it. But the love of
this world is a cheat; lovers must die, and men fade all as
leaf from bough. Lovers, quotha? <i>Where, indeed, are Paris
and Helen; where Tristram, Ysolde, and the rest; where, too,
are Hector and Cæsar?</i> As if they had never lived at all!”
At first sight this lyric of the guild seems a counterpart to
the pagan cry of Villon, as if the latter were a parody of the
old formula without the piety and with a vague touch of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>genius in the refrain; but the difference is more than this.
Villon transfers sentiment from the guild to the individual.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c012'><sup>[315]</sup></a>
It is a supreme and triumphant and epoch-making attempt
to do what the individual poet had always essayed to do and
found impossible,—to leap communal barriers entirely, and
tear himself free from the guild. The monk could not doff
his cowl; his face is hidden; his song asks the organ, the
choir, the general confession, the litany, for a background,
even when it seems fairly Wordsworthian:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Winter wakens all my care!</div>
      <div class='line'>Now these trees are waxing bare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft I sigh and mourn full “sair,”</div>
      <div class='line'>When it cometh in my thought</div>
      <div class='line'>Of this earthly joy, how it all goeth to naught.<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c012'><sup>[316]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Not so with Villon. He knows no guild, save that of the jolly
beggars; and he can do with ease what even Ronsard does
only with difficulty, and leaning on a classical staff:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sous le tombeau tout Ronsard n’ira pas,—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>paraphrase of Horace. But these ladies pass in line before
Villon for his own whim;<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c012'><sup>[317]</sup></a> they are there to throw a more
intense light upon his own personality; and the cry of the
refrain, subtle but absolute touch of individual sentiment, is
the new lyric cry.<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c012'><sup>[318]</sup></a> Across the channel this cry is echoed in
what at first hearing sounds like the veriest poem of a guild,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Dunbar’s <i>Lament for the Poets</i>,<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c012'><sup>[319]</sup></a> and in its refrain, superficially
so mediæval, <i>Timor mortis conturbat me</i>! But for
English lyric, Dunbar is the first poet of sentiment, in its
modern meaning, as Villon is for the French. In brief, the
more one studies these changes, which could be detailed to the
limits of a book, the clearer one sees that Europe learned from
Villon, Dunbar, and their fellows, to take sentiment<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c012'><sup>[320]</sup></a> instead
of the old morality, and to regard lyric verse as the bidding
to a private view of the poet’s mind. The poet now makes
himself the central point of all that he says and sees; he lays
all history, all romance, under tribute to support the burden
of his own fate and frame his proper picture; he is the sun
of the system; he serves no clan or guild, and admits his
readers only one by one to an audience. The advance from
Villon’s time is chiefly to add the intellectual to the individual,
an obvious process. Emotion has come so thoroughly under
individual control that the art is now conscious and the artist
supreme, and so thoroughly under intellectual control that the
feelings, however common and widely human their appeal,
must own the mastery of thought. The one involves the
other; for consent of emotions is a far easier affair than consent
of opinions and agreement of reasoning. Emotion is the
solvent of early superstition, traditional beliefs and affections,
in a community, as it is in an individual. “I felt,” says Rousseau,
“before I thought; it is the common lot of humanity.”<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c012'><sup>[321]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>In societies custom is a consent of instincts, an unconscious
law; legislation, definite and conscious, is a consent of thinking
individuals. A creed has always been easy to change, for it
is matter of thought; a cult, a form, a superstition, communal
instincts, in a word, go not out even with prayer and fasting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Objections against all this have little weight. One is told
that the renaissance brought uniformity and not diversity of
poetic form and thought. But that rationalism, so called,
which then came in, and which made reason superior to emotion,
worked for the individual and not, as critics say, for the
social forces in art.<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c012'><sup>[322]</sup></a> It is true that all this rational activity,
this intelligent study and discussion of the classics, led to a
certain uniformity in poetic work; but every advance in
rationalism really accents the individuality, the artistry, the
intellectual power of the poet, and leads him further from the
communal and instinctive emotional level. Keen emotion
brings men closer; keen thinking separates their paths, even
if it leads them to one destination. Communal emotion is
still the mine whence a poet gets his gold; but where the
gold was once current in mere bulk, or at best in weight, it
must now be stamped with the sharpest possible impression
of artistic thought. Or, again, one may be more precise in
one’s objection. Attacking this idea that emotion, or the mass,
rules in one age, and the individual, or thought, in another, as
something akin to Comte’s discredited evolutionary drama in
three great acts,—feeling, fancy, reason,—one may insist on
the piercing emotional individualism and subtle thinking of
the church at a time when the communal note is assumed as
dominant in mediæval life. Here again we must protest
against the tyranny of terms. What does Haym mean by
the individualism of the Middle Ages, and precisely what was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>this individualism of the church? According as one looks at
the church, one may say that it was individual or that it was
communal in its influence. There are really three elements in
the case. The people of the Middle Ages in Europe were to
a great extent organized in a communal system, for the unlettered
community kept many features of the clan, not to say of
the horde, and social growth itself was a matter of the guild.
In such relations the individual had little to say; and it was
out of these conditions that the renaissance, working first
through the Italian commonwealths, began to draw the individual
into his new career. Here, then, was the communal
life of the Middle Ages. The second element in the case is
the church as a huge guild, organized for the communal life
out of which it grew, and subordinating individual thought,
emotion, will, to the thought, emotion, and will of this whole
body. These two elements, long in undisputed power, slowly
yielded to a third. Within the church itself, and at first unable
to exist outside of it, lay this intellectualized and individualized
emotion which in later times found the church to be
its implacable foe; whether the Hebrew psalms be congregational
or personal,<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c012'><sup>[323]</sup></a> it is certain that the monk in his cell felt
them to be intensely individual, and in the hymns which he
wrote, largely by inspiration of these psalms, one finds much
of that spirit which fills a modern lyric. A hymn has two
meanings for the Christian. One is its communal meaning,
as the Scottish kirk could prove; and probably no one but a
Scot, with “the graves of the martyrs” in mind, can fully
appreciate this meaning of a congregational hymn. But to
most people a hymn has the individual note of <i>Jesus, Lover
of my Soul</i>; this is the note of early Christian hymns, and is
due to a protest against communal conditions<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c012'><sup>[324]</sup></a> made by that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>spirit of Christianity which has been its chief force in modern
times, that certification of value given to the humblest single
life, that lifting of the chattel serf into a soul; a spirit which
began and fought the long battle against tradition of race and
clan and guild. De Vigny, in his exquisite <i>Journal of a Poet</i>,<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c012'><sup>[325]</sup></a>
points out the importance of the confessional in literary
growth, and derives from this source the “romance of analysis,”
with its exaggeration of the value of a single soul. This
new accent upon the individual, due to the spirit of a new
faith, was strengthened in the Middle Ages by what one
understood of the spirit of classic poets; and when the two
forces had worked into the heart of mediæval life, mediæval
life ceased to be; modern life stood in its place, modern art,
letters, statecraft even, all inspired by the individual principle.<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c012'><sup>[326]</sup></a>
Now the mistake made by men who talk of the individualism
of the Middle Ages is that they confuse this germ of
intense personal emotion, mainly confined to the cell of the
mediæval monk, with the conditions of mediæval life at large,
conditions, by the way, which had little record in documents.
One forgets that the records, mainly made by studious monks,
would give an exaggerated importance to this personal element,
this inner life, and would ignore to a great extent the
life without. Müllenhoff did well to insist that the Middle
Ages neither spoke the speech nor wore the garb of a monkish
chronicle,—still less, it may be added, of a monkish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>hymn. With Christianity emphasizing the value of a single
soul, with the emancipation of the individual from state, guild,
church, and with the secularization of letters and art, this
habit of referring wide issues of life to the narrow fortunes
of an individual made itself master of poetry. The emotion of
a clan yielded to the emotion of a single soul. A progress of
this sort is seen in <i>Sir Patrick Spens</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, and Matthew
Arnold’s <i>Dover Beach</i>. Chronology in its higher form makes
the ballad a mediæval and communal affair, the play a thing
of art. Each deals with a Scot as centre of tragedy. In the
ballad not a syllable diverts one from a group made up of the
sailor, his comrades, and their kin. The men put to sea and
are drowned; the ladies who will sit vainly waiting, the wives
who will stand “lang, lang, wi’ their gold kaims in their hair,”
give one in belated, unconscious, and imperfect form a survival
of the old clan sorrow, a coronach in gloss. The men are
dead, the women wail, and that is all. But Macbeth, as the
crisis draws near, bewails along with his own case the general
lot of man;<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c012'><sup>[327]</sup></a> “der Menschheit ganzer Jammer fasst ihn an.”
Finally, in <i>Dover Beach</i>, modern subjectivity wails and cries
out on fate from no stress of misfortune, but quite <i>à propos de
bottes</i> and on general principles. Subtract now the changes
due to epic, dramatic, lyric form; the progress and the curve
are there. The constancy of human nature, yes; but there
are two worlds in which this constant human nature finds
varying expressions: one is the mediæval, where St. Francis
can say “laudato sia Dio mio signore con tutte le creature,
<i>specialmente messer lo frate sole</i>” ... and so on, with his
joy in nature; and one is the modern, where Wordsworth
must strike that other note, <i>my heart leaps up</i>, or whatever
else. Here, indeed, are two distinct worlds, even if it is the
same human heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, what one calls objective in modern poetry is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>objective in the communal, mediæval sense; and what one
thinks to be sentimental or even subjective in the ballads or
other communal song is not subjective or sentimental in any
modern way. A throng in those homogeneous conditions
was unsentimental in its poetical expression for the good
reason that a throng has emotions distinct from the emotions
of an individual; this, too, is why sentiment and individualism
have kept step in the progress of poetry. Tennyson is objective
enough in his verses about the widow of a slain warrior
and her rescuing tears when her child is brought to her. But
this is not really objective, not communal; it is sentiment, of
a high order to be sure, but sentiment. What a different
point of view in the commonplace of the ballads! Was the
head of the house slain and the widow left lamenting,
invariably,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Up spake the son on the nourice’s knee,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Gin I live to be a man, revenged I’ll be;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>that is true communal and objective emotion. Scott, who
was saturated with ballads and ballad lore, was the last of
English poets who could write in an impersonal and communal
way. After him always, as mostly before him, the
subjective and sentimental note came canting in even where
severest objectivity is supposed to reign. If one wishes to
feel this in Scott,—for it is a thing to feel and not to prove
by syllogisms,—one has only to read the final stanza of
<i>Bonnie Dundee</i>; not great verse, indeed, but full of a certain
unforced simplicity, a large air, a communal vigour, an echo
of unpremeditated, impersonal, roundly objective song.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c012'><sup>[328]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>There is another process in the poetry of art which serves
to disguise the real tendency toward individual instead of
communal emotion. Communal poetry had a wide, free, outdoor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>life; the modern poet is bounded in a nutshell,—but he
has his dreams. With intense subjectivity comes the need to
cover a vast range of space and time; in place of the clan or
the community, its grief and joy, set forth by the communal
song, one finds a solitary poet, a sort of sick king in Bokhara,
dealing with the universe, and putting into his lines that
quality which is best expressed in general by the often abused
name of <i>weltschmerz</i>, and in particular by those countless
passages in modern lyric like the poem which Shelley wrote
“in dejection,” or that verse of Keats which expresses so
admirably the modern lyric attitude in contrast with a singing
and dancing throng:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in15'>On the shore</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the wide world I stand alone and think.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>For this lyric daring, this voyaging through strange seas of
thought alone, this blending of personal reflection with the
whole range of human thought and human emotion, makes
poetry cosmic, but does not make it communal or even
objective. The sudden interest in savages, and the glorification
of primitive virtues, even the reasoning against reason
and the emotion for emotion, are part of the subjective process.
Jean-Jacques, Ossian, the <i>bésoin de réverie</i>, cosmopolitan
sentiment and sensibility set in vogue by Sterne,<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c012'><sup>[329]</sup></a>—all
these details of the romantic movement need no emphasis;
but it is significant that this subjective search for
the objective brought genuine communal poetry into view,
and it is by no means to the glory of the critic that he so
often puts romantic zeal and poetry of the people upon the
same plane of origins. The scientific triumphs of a century
and more have added external nature to the poet’s province;
they have put a new sympathy for natural things along with
zeal for humanity and that sense of the individual and the
artist which were due to the renaissance, justifying to the full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Bacon’s definition of art as <i>homo additus naturae</i>. Poetry
now means the emotional mood of a thinker alone with his
world; we forget that it ever meant anything else.</p>

<p class='c013'>The subjective and the sentimental in such excess must
each beget a reaction; they roll back upon themselves, and
the shock has two results, which the critic is tempted at first
sight to call objective. One is the sharp dramatic study,
where the poet puts himself into the place of another person.
The second is that great reaction of sentiment which is called
humour. As for the dramatic element, there is no question
that a would-be communal reaction, “the need of a world of
men,” follows naturally upon excess of the subjective note.
But the communal reaction cannot restore communal conditions.
The <i>we</i> of throng poetry has yielded little by little to
the lyrical <i>I-and-Thou</i>, and finally to the <i>I</i>, pure and simple.
An obvious reaction is to put the <i>I</i> into the personality of
another. This device, now so common, began in the early
renaissance by the identification of the poet, not with another
person, but with another class of persons. Burckhardt notes
the <i>Canzone Zingaresca</i> of Lorenzo as “one of the earliest
products of the purely modern impulse to put one’s self, in a
poetic and conscious manner, into the situation of a given
class of people.”<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c012'><sup>[330]</sup></a> The “objectivity” of later poets runs into
this mould; it is a conscious process, however well done, and
is quite different from the lack of all subjective interest which
marks early song. One is reminded of the splendid efforts
of Horace to bring back the courage and simplicity and austerity
of old Roman life to the Rome of Augustus. Nietzsche
may bid us build our cities on Vesuvius, and Stevenson may
revive that old love for “the bright eyes of danger”; but it
is not the old lover that the Scot revives, and the <i>silva
antiqua</i> is of modern planting. The transfer of persons
brings one no nearer to communal objectivity; it is a reaction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>against individual sentiment, which only throws into stronger
relief the prevailing tone of a poetry overwhelmingly lyric,
individual, and sentimental.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again, growing out of the same change of heart from the
communal to the personal and artistic, is that essentially modern
quality of humour, which really springs from an intensely
subjective, not to say introspective, state; it is sentiment in
disguise. One of the surest tests of communal poetry is the
lack of conscious sentiment and of conscious humour. When
we say that a ballad is pathetic, either the pathos and sentiment
are in solution with the material of the ballad, or else
we read them into the ballad outright.<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c012'><sup>[331]</sup></a> So, or nearly so,
with the humour. Communal humour is cruel; as religion,
now a matter of love, began with abject fear, laughter, so
unkind scientific folk assert, began as exultation over the torture
of a conquered foe, just as children are often amused at the
suffering of man and beast, until they take the cue of pity
from their elders. Fielding, in his reaction against overdone
sentiment, also went back to the communal idea of humour.
Parson Adams is cudgelled and abused within an inch of his
life, and in <i>Tom Jones</i> bloody heads and broken bones make
for merriment on all occasions. The squire of the picaresque
novel,—Lazarillo de Tormes for an early case, or for
a late and trivial example of tremendous adventures of this
sort, Trufaldin in Pigault-Lebrun’s <i>Folie Espagnole</i>—like
the poor hero of Cervantes, even like Mr. Pickwick, like all
the breed, may look to bear unmerciful beatings by way
of contributing to the fun. In the later ballads of Robin
Hood, tinkers and beggars trounce the hero again and again;
and it is a concession to the yokel’s point of view when the
subtle humour of Falstaff in <i>Henry IV</i> yields to those indignities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>of pinchings and the buck-basket at which modern readers
boggle in the <i>Merry Wives</i>. Burckhardt again lays under
obligation the historian of literature in general, and the champion
of this antithesis in particular, when he points out<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c012'><sup>[332]</sup></a> the
clannish and communal note of what in the Middle Ages
passed for humour. It was a thing not of individuals but of
classes, guilds, cities, towns, villages,<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c012'><sup>[333]</sup></a> countries,—collective
altogether. Jests at Scotchmen or at our own Jerseymen, and
the exchange of civilities between rival colleges, are jaded survivals
of this honest but obvious merriment. Scholars, chiefly
Teutonic by birth,<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c012'><sup>[334]</sup></a> have a way of praising this sort of thing
as sound, old, wholesome fun, <i>derber humor</i>; but it is an
acquired scholastic taste, and, as a rule, one does not lay down
his Uncle Toby to listen to mediæval banter. If modern
humour is an antidote against modern sentiment, both come
from the same source, and <i>similia similibus</i> was never more
true than here; sentiment is individualized emotion in excess,
and humour is the recoil. Walpole had this in mind when
he said that life is a tragedy to one who feels, but a comedy
to one who thinks. The humour which springs from excessive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>thought, from sentiment in reaction, is at the world’s end
from that rough and boisterous communal fun; it is equally
removed from delight in tragedy, itself a sign of youth.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c012'><sup>[335]</sup></a> To
trace the course of modern poetic humour from Chaucer, Villon,
Dunbar, down to Heine, who does in verse what Sterne
did in prose, would be “a journey like the path to heaven,”
in whichever sense one chooses to take the comparison,—delightful
or difficult; enough in this place to point out the
flickering humour that plays across the subjectivity and sentiment
of Heine’s <i>Death Bed</i>,<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c012'><sup>[336]</sup></a> with its parody of Homer, its
scorn for the public, and all the rest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such are the chief differencing factors of the poetry of
art as they appear in process of evolution from the Middle
Ages to the present time. They belong to poetic material;
a further result of the process appears in poetic style. Individual
and sentimental poetry has developed a poetic
dialect and widened the gap between the speech of a poet
and the speech of common life. This goes deeper than
conventional phrases and epic repetitions, which at first sight
induce one to assert precisely the opposite view and call
modern poetry a return from the conventional to the simple
in expression. Emotion, however, that is spontaneous, communal,
direct, and without taint of reflection, will catch the
nearest way and avoid deliberate or conscious figures of
speech, the trope or “turning” peculiar to our verse; and
there is a steady progress in poetry from the simple or
natural<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c012'><sup>[337]</sup></a>—which does not exclude the metaphorical, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>only metaphor be the outcome of unconscious processes of
speech—to the tropical; poetry little by little makes its
own dialect.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c012'><sup>[338]</sup></a> Of course there are excesses and subsequent
returns to simplicity, witness the metaphysical school of
poets in England; but the tendency is always to the individual,
which is the unusual and unexpected, and hence
to the metaphorical. Precisely, too, as sentiment turned
upon itself, so the metaphorical turns upon itself and makes
a metaphor out of the literal; for example, Professor Woodberry
in his sonnet on a portrait of Columbus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Is this the face, and these the <i>finding eyes</i>?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But this simplicity and objective force of poetic language,
rarely so successful as here, and rare in any case, is itself
subjective and the outcome of individual assertion.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is now in order to look at survivals of communal and
primitive verse, and to learn from a study of their differencing
factors no longer what the beginnings of poetry were
not, but what they really were.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />THE DIFFERENCING ELEMENTS OF COMMUNAL POETRY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Survival of primitive and communal poetry as it can be
detected in the ballads and the popular rimes of Europe, in
the songs of those savage tribes which seem to come nearest
to conditions of prehistoric life, and in the beginnings of
national literatures so far as any trustworthy record remains,
must now be studied analytically, not as poems, but rather
with a view to the elements which difference poetry of the
people from the poetry of individual art. That a considerable
body of verse, European as well as savage, represents
the community in mass rather than the solitary poet, is universally
conceded; it is generally but not universally conceded
that the making of such communal poetry is under
modern conditions a closed account. If this view is correct,
a curve of decline and extinction can be drawn corresponding
to that curve of the developing artistic and individual
type considered above. With this assertion of a closed
account, however, must go a caution of great weight; the
actual traditional ballad of Europe is not to be carried back
into prehistoric conditions. A process of this sort brings
ridicule upon arguments which ought to be made in rational
terms; and it is to the elements of prehistoric poetry surviving
in a ballad, and in kindred verse, that one must look, not
to the whole poem, which is a complex of communal and
artistic materials. One may say without fear of a contradiction
in terms that the ballad has in it elements which go back
to certain conditions of poetic production utterly unknown to
the modern poem of art. These elements also occur as fragments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>in popular rimes; but the ballad has drawn chief
attention because it is a complete and readable poem in
itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>These ballads of Europe have a large literature both of collection
and of criticism;<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c012'><sup>[339]</sup></a> and in some cases, notably the
English, collection of material has the melancholy advantage
of being final. Despite arguments of Mr. Joseph Jacobs
and Dr. John Meier,<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c012'><sup>[340]</sup></a> the making of ballads is a closed
account; that is, a popular ballad of to-day, even if one
allows the term to pass, is essentially different from a ballad
such as one finds in the collection of Professor Child. Conditions
of production in the street, the concert, the <i>café-chantant</i>,
even in the rural gatherings<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c012'><sup>[341]</sup></a> controlled by that
“bucolic wit,” are different from the conditions of production
which prevailed in a homogeneous and unlettered community
of mediæval Europe. A. E. Berger, in a popular
essay<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c012'><sup>[342]</sup></a> which may go with that of Dr. John Meier as representing
an extravagant rationalism now in vogue about
poetry of the people quite as extreme as the extravagant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>romanticism of Grimm, limits the difference between this
poetry and the poetry of art to the difference of oral and
of written record; but he quite concedes the closed account.
Here, however, the two rationalists get into a deadlock. Dr.
Meier will not allow the closed account, goes back to Steinthal,
and against the modern view asserts that <i>dichten des
volks</i>, the ownership of a poem by the folk at large, who
sing it into a thousand changing forms. The process
according to Meier is now what it always has been, first an
individual composition, then oblivion of the individual and
popularity for the song, which is felt by the people—“a
necessary condition of folk-poetry”—to be their own, with
manifold changes due in no case to any artistic purpose or
deliberation. Now in all this Dr. Meier puts himself at odds
with the defenders of oral poetry as held apart from written
and printed verse, a distinction which he ignores. He
agrees with them that, in the words of Berger, “there is
no organic difference between poetry of the people and the
poetry of art;” but the difference that does exist for Meier
prettily contradicts the difference assumed by the others,
Berger and the rest regarding the ballad, a thing of oral
tradition, as now out of date. Not only does one test neutralize
the other test, but both parties to this deadlock take a
point of view fatal to any real mastery of the subject. They
fail to look at the conditions under which communal poetry
was produced, and they fail to study it in its essential elements.
From this proper point of view, however, it is clear that traditional
ballads were not made as a song of the street or the
concert-hall is now made, and it is clear that ballads of that
communal kind are not made under modern conditions. It
has just been shown that the difference between mediæval
poetry at large and poetry of the day may be best expressed
in terms of the guild and the community as against the individual
and subjective note. Poetry of the guild, if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>phrase will pass, was composed by poets of the guild and
found a record; we are wont to think that sort of thing
made up all mediæval poetry; but the community itself had
a vast amount of song which was composed in public and for
the occasion, found no written record, and is recovered only
in varying traditional forms. The conditions of modern life
forbid the old communal expression, free and direct; but of
course the throng is still bound to voice its feelings, and
takes the poetry of art, masters it, owns it, changes it,
precisely as Dr. Meier contends, but with no very edifying
results. Every collection of ballads, even of folksongs, with
their dignity, their note of distinction, compared with sorry
stuff of the streets, bears witness to this difference between
old and new. Landstad<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c012'><sup>[343]</sup></a> in 1848 noted that ballads were
fast vanishing from Norway. Bujeaud<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c012'><sup>[344]</sup></a> complains that in
France “new” and fatuous verses supplant traditional song;
and he gives as example a “chanson nouvelle dédiée à une
jeune fille.” Ralston,<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c012'><sup>[345]</sup></a> for Russia, comments on the new
popular verse “laboriously produced in the towns and unblushingly
fathered upon soldiers and gypsies.” Save in a
few dialects, the old runes, and with them the power to make
popular song, are dying out in Finland; communal poetry
there is going to pieces, and the process confirms what was
said above about the relations of feeling and thought in
verse.<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c012'><sup>[346]</sup></a> Throughout Germany<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c012'><sup>[347]</sup></a> the current ballads and folksongs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>are seldom even traditional; hardly anywhere are they
made in field and spinning-room as they were made half a
century ago. At the annual dinner of the border shepherds,
held at Yetholm in the Cheviots, so Sir George Douglas<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c012'><sup>[348]</sup></a>
relates, “there is no longer any thought of native inspiration;
the songs sung after dinner are of the type familiar in
more vulgar localities, and known as ‘songs of the day.’
Even the old ballads are neglected.” Traditional native
songs of the countryside have vanished from the fields and
villages of Europe, and are replaced by opera airs, sentimental
ditties, and the like; Loquin’s attempt<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c012'><sup>[349]</sup></a> to refer the old
songs to similar sources is anything but a success; indeed,
as one hears the new and thinks of the old, one is reminded
of an ignoble analogy in the habit of many farmers here in
eastern America, who sell their fresh fruit and vegetables, or
neglect to raise any, and use with relish and a kind of pride
the inevitable “canned goods.” On many farms the kitchen-garden
has vanished like the old songs.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c012'><sup>[350]</sup></a> Apart from these
base respects, however, it is clear that the throng is powerless
to revive even mediæval conditions; and the traditional
ballad, as every competent editor either asserts or implies, is
no longer to be made. Ferdinand Wolf, Grundtvig,<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c012'><sup>[351]</sup></a> Talvj,
and a number of others, declare that the homogeneous and
unlettered community, now no longer with us, is the only
source of a genuine ballad. True, communities can still be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>found which have something of the old conditions and of the
old power. Mr. Baring-Gould notes that in divers places
English folk still sing, perhaps even make, the good and
genuine song. A correspondent of the <i>New York Evening
Post</i>, in a pleasant letter<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c012'><sup>[352]</sup></a> describing the Magyar dance and
song, notes that these people prefer singing to talking, and
makes the statement that “there is scarcely a stable-boy or a
kitchen-maid who has not, at some time, been the creator of
at least one song—both words and music. The favourite
time for launching these ventures on the part of the young
women is when they gather to spin in the evenings.” Sir
George Douglas, in the note already quoted, says that ballads
of tradition have retreated from shepherds to “a yet
shyer and less sophisticated set of men, to wit, the fishermen
of the smaller fishing towns.” It is said, too, that conditions
quite analogous to those of the old Scottish border, and ballads
of corresponding quality, some of them, indeed, very
ancient ballads of tradition, may be found in the mountains
of Kentucky. But this is all sporadic and dying activity. In
favoured places it is still true, as Professor E. H. Meyer says
of Germany, that communal singing lingers,<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c012'><sup>[353]</sup></a> but even this is
moribund; and communal making, so he admits, is dead.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c012'><sup>[354]</sup></a>
More than this: no modern poet, however great, has yet
succeeded in reviving the ballad in imitation. Scott, not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>speak of the failures of Leyden and Sharpe, made poems in
some respects as good as the old ballads, and made a beautiful
bit of verse—<i>Proud Maisie is in the Wood</i>—very like a
folksong; but they are not the real ballad, the real folksong,
and Scott would have been first to deny the identity.
As for the street songs and that sort of verse, from the wheezing
sentimental ditties down,<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c012'><sup>[355]</sup></a> one has only to compare them
with genuine old ballads to see how utterly they fail to meet
any test of really communal poetry. Even three centuries
ago, when earth was nearer the ballad heaven than now,
broadsides, “garlands,” trash of the street and the hawker’s
basket, all balladry of trade, were sharply sundered from
the good old songs. One knows what Ben Jonson thought
of “ballading silk-weavers” and the rest; one also knows
the saying attributed to him by Addison that he would
rather have been author of <i>Chevy Chace</i> than of all his
own works.<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c012'><sup>[356]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A word is needed, however, before one passes from this
matter of the closed account, in regard to a notion that
people hold about modern communal song. It is still
made, they say, by the lower classes, but it is too indecent
for currency, and is conventionally unknown. Now it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>a fact which may well get emphasis here, that the real
ballad of tradition, while it never boggles at a plain name
for things now rather understood than expressed, is at a
vast remove from the obscene, and from those hulking
indecencies which, along with the vapid and the sentimental,
make up the bulk of modern unprinted and unmentioned
song. Herd printed a few high-kilted ballads,<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c012'><sup>[357]</sup></a> but even age
refuses to lend them the appearance of communal and traditional;
and the chasm grows wider when one deals with an
audacious collection like that of Mr. Farmer,<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c012'><sup>[358]</sup></a> where “high-kilted”
is a mild name for nearly all the specimens. Here,
now, are those “songs of Burns”—to which Blémont appealed
for proof that the popular muse is still prolific—running
to a favourite tune, but on the forbidden ground;
here are obscenities, drolleries, <i>facetiae</i>, such as grooms and
the baser sort still sing everywhere, and such as the Roman
scratched on a wall. Here are the songs in cold print, and
with the label “national”; it is no answer to ignore them.
But when some one nods his head shrewdly, and stands
with arms encumbered, and says one could, if one would,
show this same old ballad still made by bards of the people
and sung up and down the land as aforetime, only it is not
fit for ears foolishly polite, and all the rest,—then, indeed,
it is well to bring the matter to book. For these songs are
not really traditional ballads, and never belonged to the
community as a whole; the ballad of old oral tradition did
belong to the community as a whole. Quite apart from
ethics, with no rant after the manner of Vilmar, it is to be
remembered that communal poetry, sung in a representative
throng, cannot well be obscene; made by the public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and in public, it cannot conceivably run against the public
standard of morality. Australian songs such as Scherer
studied shock the European; maypole songs of older England
were an offence to the Puritan; mediæval doings
on Shrove-Tuesday night were not to edification; crowds
as well as individuals even now like at times to give voice
to their belief in cakes and ale; but notwithstanding all
these allowances, it is clear that a song made and sung
by a really communal crowd will give no room to private
vices and to those events and situations which get their
main charm from a centrifugal tendency with regard to
public morals. This hole-and-corner minstrelsy is no part
of communal song; for further proof, one may note the
few genuine old ballads, quite free from indecencies, which
Mr. Farmer prints, and which are such a foil to the superfluity
of naughtiness before and after. They are of a different
world. In short, the main thing is to remember the
protest made so strongly by Herder and by Richard Wagner.
“Folk,—that does not mean the rabble of the street,” ran
Herder’s formula<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c012'><sup>[359]</sup></a> for the past; while Wagner<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c012'><sup>[360]</sup></a> describes
the united “folk” of the future for whom and from whom
alone art of a high order may be expected. But Wagner’s
folk of the future can never be that homogeneous, unlettered
folk of a mediæval community from which sprang our communal
verse of tradition. “Many epochs,” says Bruchmann,<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c012'><sup>[361]</sup></a>
“give one the impression as if in old times singing and the
making of poetry were universal gifts. This is psychologically
conceivable. The more uniform the intellectual life of
individuals ... <i>the more we may expect uniform utterance
of that life. So the poetry of such a time would be entirely</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span><i>poetry of the people</i>.” It is clear that such conditions are
far removed from the present,<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c012'><sup>[362]</sup></a> and that the making of communal
poetry in any appreciable quantity or quality must
now be a closed account.</p>

<p class='c013'>So much for the curve of evolution by which these communal
elements of poetry decline as they approach our time, and
increase as one retraces the path of poetry and song. But
one is by no means to suppose that the ballad of tradition, as
it lies before one now, can be taken as an accurate type of
earliest communal song. <i>Sir Patrick Spens</i> and <i>Innsprück,
ich muss dich lassen</i> are not perfect examples of the songs
which primitive man used to sing, not even of the original
mediæval ballad such as the women made about St. Faro in
France or as those islanders made a hundred years ago about
the frustrated fisherman. Improvisation in a throng cannot
give the unity of purpose and the touch of art which one finds
in <i>Spens</i>; that comes partly from individual and artistic
strands woven in with the communal stuff, and partly from
the process by which a ballad constantly sung in many places,
and handed down by oral tradition alone, selects as if by its
own will the stanzas and phrases which best suit its public.
What one asserts, however, is that in this ballad of <i>Spens</i>,
although in less degree than with other ballads, the presence
of artistic elements is overcome by the preponderating influence
of certain communal elements. These communal
elements are to be studied in all available material, and consist,
taken in the mass, of repetitions of word and phrase,
chorus, refrain, singing, dancing, and traces of general improvisation;
and all these elements, except for imitative
purposes, are lacking in the poem of art, or if present, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>overwhelmed by the artistic elements. Even in the ballads
which have gone on record, and are made artistic to some
degree by this very act,—killed with kindness,—there are
still more traces of the throng than of the individual artist;
this transfer from conditions of communal making and tradition
to conditions of artistic record must always be taken
into account. The collector of oral tradition, particularly
ballads, finds it nigh impossible to write them down in their
uncontaminated state; he gathers flowers, but what he puts
into his book is only a <i>hortus siccus</i>. Anecdotes in proof of
this abound; one may be quoted from the account given by
Hogg<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c012'><sup>[363]</sup></a> of a visit from Scott in 1802, soon after the publication
of the <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>, where Scott printed some
ballads which the Ettrick shepherd had taken down from his
mother’s singing. Now the mother was face to face with
Scott, and sang him the ballad of <i>Old Maitlan’</i>; delighted,
Scott asked her if it had ever been in print. No, she said;
never one of her songs had been printed till Scott had
printed them, and in doing so he had entirely spoiled
them. “They were made for singing an’ no for reading;
but ye hae broken the charm now, an’ they’ll never
be sung mair.” And Hogg adds: “My mother has been
too true a prophetess, for from that day to this, these
songs, which were the amusement of every winter evening,
have never been sung more.”—And now to these vanishing
or vanished songs themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>We are to examine the European ballad or traditional
narrative song, and compare its elements with such shards of
communal verse as are still found here and there, and with
ethnological material; lyric of the people and refrains for the
dance will be studied in another place. The lyric, though
simple and “popular” enough, is mainly an affair of the
lover and his lass, and has the centrifugal more than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>communal tendency even in that jolly little song, now six or
seven hundred years old, which jumps so easily into English,
the <i>Du bist mîn</i>:<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c012'><sup>[364]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c013'>Refrains for the dance,<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c012'><sup>[365]</sup></a> of course, are communal and
express communal joy; one of them, with both the interjectional
and the full refrain, leaves no doubt at all; it is a song
for the dance of May:<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c012'><sup>[366]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c013'>To these refrains of the dance we shall return in due time;
the bulk of popular lyric is simple, rural, but not communal.
There remain the epic survival, the ballad, and popular
rimes. Epic in the larger sense is not to be considered here;
for it comes down to us at the hands of art, communal as
it may have been in its beginnings, and it is not a simple
contemporary note of deeds which have a merely local and
social interest, a stage of development common to most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>traditional ballads.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c012'><sup>[367]</sup></a> One sees, if one will glance at the
actual ballad, why theories of Niebuhr and of Buckle about
the foundation of history in artless chronicles of this communal
type must be taken with great reserve<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c012'><sup>[368]</sup></a> and reduced to
very slender assertion. Not in early history, not even in the
great epics, not even by help of the Homeric question, can
one study communal elements to the best advantage, but
rather in simple ballads of tradition, in the communal narrative
song.<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c012'><sup>[369]</sup></a> It is sung, danced,—hence the rhythm of it;
it tells of some communal happening—“the germ of folksong
is an event,” says Böckel,<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c012'><sup>[370]</sup></a>—hence the narrative.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>What, now, are the tests and characteristics about which
writers on the ballad are agreed? All agree that it is a
narrative song usually preserved by oral tradition of the
people. With few and unimportant exceptions, it is agreed
that a ballad must be the expression and outcome of a homogeneous
and unlettered community;<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c012'><sup>[371]</sup></a> the dispute is about
origins. Grimm and sundry of his day declared that the
community itself made the ballad; Grundtvig said the same
thing, and Ten Brink, following certain modifications of
Steinthal, held the people, and not an individual poet, responsible
for the making as well as the singing. Ferdinand
Wolf<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c012'><sup>[372]</sup></a> was sturdy enough in his scorn for the “nebulous
poet-aggregate called folk,” although he clung to the homogeneous
community as absolute condition; and his task was
to find a representative who could make the ballad to express
such a community. Since ballads deal mainly with knights
and persons of rank, he concluded, as Geijer had done, that
they were due to “a person of quality”; Prior, the translator,<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c012'><sup>[373]</sup></a>
went even a step farther and was inclined to think that for
Scandinavian ballads, and presumably other poems of the
class, one is indebted “to the ladies.” Prior is negligible.
But Wolf was careful in his statement; and when he noted
the predominance of aristocratic persons in the deeds which
these ballads sing, he knew that it was a common trait in all
heroic and early epic. Germanic poems of this class, the
<i>Béowulf</i>, the Hildebrand Lay, what not, regard only such
characters and not the common man. As Dr. R. M. Meyer
points out, this is even carried into the lifeless world, and all
things are in superlative; all is splendid, unusual, extreme.<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c012'><sup>[374]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Even Icelandic sagas deal only with the representative man,
with distinguished and notable folk.<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c012'><sup>[375]</sup></a> So Wolf simply said
that the ballad was made in this class of society, in a homogeneous
class, a <i>volk von rittern</i> as he calls it,<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c012'><sup>[376]</sup></a> who mainly
“sang their own deeds,”—an important concession. Even
if one granted this, and allowed the court poet himself to
appear in an impersonal way as deputy of the knights in
singing about their deeds, it would still be far from individual
and deliberate poetry of art, but rather poetry of the guild
with a definite theme, traditional form, and recurrent phrases
from the common poetic stock.<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c012'><sup>[377]</sup></a> However, the homogeneous
and unlettered conditions of a ballad-making community are
in themselves enough to account for this preference of rank;
the knight, chieftain, warrior, represented his folk, and was
hardly raised above them in any intellectual way. Not only
were all the members of a community consolidated, at first,
against hunger, cold, and hostile tribes, the primitive homogeneity
of the horde, but even later, in mediæval civilization,
the same roof often covered the knight and his humblest
retainer, the same food fed them, and both were marked by
the same standards of action, the same habit of thought, the
same sentiments, the same lack of letters,<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c012'><sup>[378]</sup></a> of introspection,
of diversified mental employment. Even in rural England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>such conditions lingered long; Overbury’s franklin<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c012'><sup>[379]</sup></a> “says
not to his servants, Goe to field, but Let us goe;” and at
the harvest home, where old songs prevail even in modern
times, there is “no distinction of persons, but master and
servant sit at the same table, converse freely together, and
spend the remainder of the night in dancing and singing, on
terms of easy familiarity.”<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c012'><sup>[380]</sup></a> How this state of things is
intensified in the Highland clan, every one knows; and in
going back to the horde there can be no doubt in regard to
the sharp curve toward communal conditions and communal
expression. Now as to those aristocratic personages of the
ballad, the canticles of love and woe which come from such
a community would of course put in the foreground of action
persons who actually filled the foreground of its life. The
ballad represented a compact communal life, and this passed
into song in the person of its best representative; hence the
panegyric found in all early poetry, the praise of great men
who are made one with “the fathers who begat us,” not to
be explained away as work of Scherer’s primitive minstrel,
liar and entertainer passing about his hat for primitive pence.
It is with modern conditions of life, and with the diversity of
modern thought, that art comes down to the middle classes,—what
throes were needed to bring the domestic or citizen
tragedy to light!—then to the artisan, to peasants, and finally
to the outcast, the criminal, the degenerate, as in sundry
clever sketches of Alexander Kielland. Homogeneous conditions
are first broken by cities, and linger longest in the
country; they were particularly strong in primitive agricultural
life;<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c012'><sup>[381]</sup></a> and it is in communities of this sort, remote, islanded
in the sea of civilization, that most of the traditional ballads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>have been found. When one thinks of this poetry at its best
estate, one must have the old continent and not these sinking
islands before one’s thought. Nor is the lowest form of
culture, degraded and sordid, even when of this homogeneous
kind, to be taken as model for the past. One is loath to
think of the old ballad community in terms of Zola’s <i>Terre</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is, however, another way by which one could account
for aristocratic personages and doings of the ballad; this wayside
strolling muse may be dressed in the clothes cast off by
her high-born sisters of epic and romance. This, as was said
above, F. Wolf<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c012'><sup>[382]</sup></a> denied; but J. F. Campbell<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c012'><sup>[383]</sup></a> defines the ballad
somewhat in such terms. Mr. Newell<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c012'><sup>[384]</sup></a> thinks the folk-tale
a degenerate form, in low levels of culture, of something
composed on higher levels and at an earlier time; as if once
D’Urberville, now Durbeyfield. Often true for the material
of an individual ballad, this is not true of its real elements,
of the ballad <i>qua</i> ballad, and of its form and vital characteristics.
The pattern of ballads whence one will;<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c012'><sup>[385]</sup></a> the stuff of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the ballad is communal. If the ballad as a form of poetry
were a mere ragbag of romance, one would find in it tags of
old phrases, ambitious figures, tricks and turns of speech,
change in metrical structure, and all manner of crumbs from
the literary table; but these are conspicuous by their absence.
The ballad as ballad is original. Count Nigra<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c012'><sup>[386]</sup></a> gives an important
reason for this point of view when he notes that the
materials of a ballad go anywhere, pass all borders, while
metre, rime, and form in general, are borrowed only from
<i>popoli omoglotti</i>. The ballads employ speech at first hand,
no borrowed phrases, a simple, living language; and always
the feeling and the expression are coördinate. The ballad is
no foul and spent stream that has turned millwheels, run
through barnyards, and at last found its way to a ditch; it is
wild water, and not far from its source in the mountains.
One proof lies in the drinking of it. Ballads still hold their
own as the nearest approach to primitive poetry preserved
among civilized nations, scanty as the records are; and after
infinite discussion of Homeric and other theories, the ballad
remains in its old position at the gates of every national literature.<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c012'><sup>[387]</sup></a>
The farther one comes into the conditions which
made for the ballad, this homogeneous community, this unlettered
and undeliberative habit of mind, so much wider one
finds diffused the power of improvising and singing verses
in a style which is easy to bring into line with the style of
traditional ballads. For the ballad in its purity was always
sung, and singing is a primary process; romances were recited.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>In other words, power to make poetry of this sort does
not begin with the rich and foremost few, and spread slowly
among the lower classes; it begins, this is beyond all doubt,<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c012'><sup>[388]</sup></a>
as a universal gift, and only with the rise of classes and the
diversity of mental training, lettered against unlettered, is the
power restricted to a narrow range.</p>

<p class='c013'>Well, the ballad as species is no making of mediæval aristocrats,
ladies or knights, no shards of chivalry and romance;
but what of the minstrel? Bishop Percy, Scott, and of late
Professor Courthope and Mr. Henderson, have looked to the
minstrel to explain the ballad and all its ways. Doubtless
many a minstrel made ballads, or rather sang them into
modern shape; but the minstrel is merely a link between
later artistic poetry and older communal song. He cannot
explain this communal song, for he cannot explain the elements
of it,—festal crowd, dance, singing, rapid and universal
improvisation, repetition, refrain; he inherits what these
leave as they vanish from living poetry; and that is all. He
does not explain them, but they explain him. Professor
Child distinguishes between the “minstrel ballad” and the
“popular ballad”;<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c012'><sup>[389]</sup></a> but one is willing to hand over better
stuff to this amiable rover and allow him a share in many
good songs, without prejudice of any kind to the real communal
theory. Gustav Meyer, however, one of the ablest
scholars that modern Germany has produced, puts<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c012'><sup>[390]</sup></a> the wane
of balladry at the point where improvisation by men and
women in the fields and round the village linden ceases, and
where the minstrel brotherhood, whether blind singers, rhapsodes,
or what not, begins.<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c012'><sup>[391]</sup></a> The minstrel ballad is only a stage
on that broad road which ends in the stalls; while, conversely,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>a ballad of the stalls may often hide real poetry of tradition
under an ignoble garment. It is clear, then, that the “I” of
a ballad ought to disturb the idea of communal origins as little
as the borrowed subject does; but when one forgets the singing,
dancing, improvising crowd, and thinks of poetry only in
terms of modern literary composition, inference is made that
ought not to be made at all. Professor Francke,<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c012'><sup>[392]</sup></a> for example,
thinks that the “I” of a German folksong, or that tag
at the end which declares the song to have been made by
a student, a pilgrim, a fisherman, is proof positive that ballads
had individual authorship. The song is a folksong, he says,
simply and solely because folk take it up and sing it; thus
the often quoted <i>Limburg Chronicle</i> noted that “this year”
the folk sang so-and-so, and all men know that in 1898 the
American “folk” sang by preference <i>There’ll be a Hot Time</i>.
Böhme,<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c012'><sup>[393]</sup></a> indeed, thinks that a leprous monk<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c012'><sup>[394]</sup></a> mentioned in
the <i>Limburg Chronicle</i>, whose tunes and songs had such a
vogue five hundred years ago, brings to light the secrets of
the origins of popular poetry. It is odd, however, that
Böhme goes on to show how popular poetry differs from the
poetry of art, and asks, with great <i>naïveté</i>, why one should
ever ask for the author of a folksong, seeing that it was never
really composed at all! “It was a masterless and nameless
affair,” he says; and proceeds to quote—Jacob Grimm. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>for serious answer, it is plain that folksong is an equivocal
term. Most of the popular songs, by their nature, must be
individual; the universal appeal, the fact that all the world
loves a lover, does not make them communal. It was a lad
and a lover who sang <i>Innsprück, ich muss dich lassen</i>; and it
needs no signature. But from this <i>ich</i> to the “I” of the tags
which one finds at the end of narrative ballads of tradition,
is a far cry; indeed there is a gulf between them. When
one comes to the refrain, which always expresses or implies
a “we,” there is absolutely no chance for “I”; but writers
on ballads give the refrain a wide berth. However, leave
this refrain out of the reckoning; even in actual ballads the
“I” is oftenest a mere recorder’s signature, and simply mediates
between the reader and communal origins. With most
English and Scottish ballads there is no “I” in the case; but
even if one could find for each and all of these ballads signs of
such a singer, editor, recorder, there would still remain behind
this “I” certain facts, certain elements, which demand a
totally different explanation. Let us look at another declaration
of authorship. A Breton song,<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c012'><sup>[395]</sup></a> called <i>The Good Old
Times</i> and sung by workingmen, ends with these verses:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>This song was made on the eve of Lady Day after supper.</div>
      <div class='line'>It was made by twelve men dancing on the knoll by the chapel.</div>
      <div class='line'>Three are ragpickers; seven sow the rye; two are millers.</div>
      <div class='line'>And so it is made, O folk, so it is made, and so it is made, this song!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Suppose, on the other side of the account,<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c012'><sup>[396]</sup></a> one should proclaim
this as a great find to offset the leprous monk; here, by
explicit statement, is a ballad made by twelve labourers of one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>mind,<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c012'><sup>[397]</sup></a> here is the communal song,—and so forth! But the
statement, interesting as it is, does nothing for any theory of
authorship; what concerns one here is the evident dance, the
folk assembled, the knoll by the chapel, the repetition, and the
refrain, which is more prominent in other parts of the long
ballad: in a word, the communal elements. Let us hear what
these elements really are. “So,” runs Villemarqué’s note
to this ballad, “so the mountain folk sing, <i>holding one
another by the hand, and continually making a half-circle
from left to right, then right to left</i>,<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c012'><sup>[398]</sup></a> raising and dropping
their hands in concert to the cadence, and leaping
after the fashion of the <i>ritornello</i>.” In fact, as Villemarqué
had already said in his preface, “the greater part of these
songs and ballads of the people are made in the same way.
Conversation stirs the throng to excitement; ‘let us make
a dance-song!’ cries some one, and it is done.... The
texture, due to the general mood, has unity, of course, but
with a certain variety of parts. Each one weaves in his flower,
according to his fancy, his humour, his trade.” This matter
will be regarded more closely under the head of Improvisation;
but the <i>gemeinsames dichten</i> is a fact, and the
communal background is cleared of at least a part of the haze
which hides it from modern view. In any case, these
signatures<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c012'><sup>[399]</sup></a> prove nothing either way; one must go below the
surface and behind the signature, if one will come at the
differencing qualities of communal poetry. Once more be it
said that the present object is not to assert communal authorship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>in any literal sense, for the ballad of the collections,
but to show in it elements which cannot be referred to individual
art, and which are of great use in determining the
probable form and origins of primitive poetry. True, one
might go farther; there are some strong statements made by
scholars of great repute which definitely deny individual
authorship, in any modern sense, for the ballad. Böckel,<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c012'><sup>[400]</sup></a>
speaking of more recent ballads, rejects, of course, the
theory of Grimm, but makes the ballad spring from improvisation
of a stanza or so in connection with traditional
stanzas of the communal stock. That one ballad has one
author, and is made in the way of modern composition of
poetry, Böckel, who has studied the remains of rustic balladry
with great care and thoroughness, denies again and
again. Count Nigra, in the work just quoted, is very emphatic
on this point. “This popular narrative song,” he says, “is
anonymous. <i>It is not improvised by a popular poet more or
less known.</i>” It requires “a period of incubation, upon which
follows a long elaboration, which goes on with divers phases
and changes, until the song falls, little by little, into oblivion,
or else is fixed in the record.” All popular verse, he declares,
like language, “is a spontaneous creation, essentially racial.”<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c012'><sup>[401]</sup></a>
M. Gaston Paris, too, would not lay much stress upon the
“I” of a ballad; early popular poetry, he asserts,<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c012'><sup>[402]</sup></a> is “improvised
and contemporaneous with its facts”; and such songs<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c012'><sup>[403]</sup></a>
are not only “composed under the immediate impression of
the event, but <i>by those and for those</i> who have taken
part in it.” In line with evidence to be set forth below,
he<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c012'><sup>[404]</sup></a> cares little for the professional minstrels as a source of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>early popular song, and doubts their existence among the
primitive Germans; for the skill to make and sing verses was
as common then as the skill to fight, and warriors sang the
songs which they themselves had made.<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c012'><sup>[405]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>But there is not only this negative evidence to dispose of
the “I” in ballads. Hebrew poetry has been thought to touch
the highest individual note in the “I” of the Psalms; but
the best Hebrew scholars<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c012'><sup>[406]</sup></a> now accept to a greater or less
extent the notion that in many places, if not in all, this “I”
is communal, and means the house or congregation of Israel.
Smend<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c012'><sup>[407]</sup></a> goes so far as to take the “I” throughout in this
sense, and doubtless he goes too far; Budde<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c012'><sup>[408]</sup></a> is on safer
ground. But the consent of the best scholars is that “I”
often means the community, and this, so Smend insists, not
as a deliberate “personification” of Israel as a church, but in
the unconscious and communal spirit of a homogeneous and
intensely emotional body of people. So the Greek chorus,
not simply the leader but the whole chorus,<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c012'><sup>[409]</sup></a> speak often as
“I”; and Smend quotes a stanza to the same effect from
Horace’s <i>Carmen Sæculare</i>. It is clear that one is on the
traces of a primitive habit which seems impossible to us only
because we have no homogeneous conditions to bring about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>such a state of mind. Now and then a hint is gained from
some survival, however faint, of these conditions. It is said
that a Scot of the Border coming home to find his house
plundered, could tell by sundry signs what hostile band had
done the deed, and would invariably call them by the place
where they lived: “Ettrickdale has been here!” One
thinks of the tribes of Israel and of the way in which their
names were used. Reuben, runs the text, “Reuben had
great searchings of heart.” But here is theological ground,
and we hasten back to the “I” of folksong. To this subject
Professor Steenstrup devotes the third chapter of his book on
Scandinavian ballads,<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c012'><sup>[410]</sup></a> which are mainly heroic and strongly
objective, in contrast to the more subjective and deliberate
ballads of Germany. Now many of the Scandinavian ballads
begin with the familiar phrase, “I will sing you—or tell you—a
song,” and proceed in the second stanza with actual narrative;
a comparison of manuscripts, however, shows that it
is mainly late copies which begin with this “I” stanza, while
earlier copies omit it. In English ballads the “I” is quite
as separable and negligible; sometimes, in songs and catches,
it is used for mystification:<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c012'><sup>[411]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He that made this songe full good,</div>
      <div class='line'>Came of the northe and of the sothern blode,</div>
      <div class='line'>And somewhat kyne to Robyn Hood,—</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Yit all we be nat soo.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And the refrain follows. In the <i>Gest of Robin Hood</i>, and in
the other ballads of this cycle, “I,” that is to say, the singer,
now bids hearers “lithe and listen,” or throws in an aside or a
gloss,—“I pray to God woo be he,” about the “great-headed
monk”; with which compare the delightful ejaculation in
<i>Young Beichan</i>, “And I hope this day she sall be his bride,”—now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>notes the end of a canto, as in the <i>Cheviot</i>, “the first fit
here I fynde”;<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c012'><sup>[412]</sup></a> and makes other detached and alien remarks
of the sort. In Russian ballads, as Bistrom<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c012'><sup>[413]</sup></a> points out, the
singer addresses his hearers only at the beginning and at the
end, often not at all. Evidently, here is a mere singer and
recorder, a link between the old singing and dancing throng
and the new listening throng; in no case is he a maker, so
far as traditional ballads go, and in Scandinavian ballads
Steenstrup has proved him to be an impertinence.<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c012'><sup>[414]</sup></a> This is
said with due allowance for the functions of a leader in communal
dance and song, where the “I” little by little got his
foothold and his importance; he steps forward with uplifted
beaker and begins a new movement, singing a subjective
verse or two, then effaces himself from the narrative ballad
which now goes with the dance.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c012'><sup>[415]</sup></a> “I bid you all dance,”
he cries, “and we will sing of so-and-so.” This introductory
stanza, of course, has got into the ballad; and the lyric opening
of many a ballad, often touching on the time of year, the
place, what not, and often, too, of great beauty, is in most
cases to be referred to such an origin. When the ballad is
recited, the leader turns recorder, editor, improver, commentator,
improvising bard. That damnable iteration in long-winded
epics and romances and in later ballads, “this is true
that I tell you,” belongs to the reciting stage;<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c012'><sup>[416]</sup></a> it is an alien
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>in balladry. More than this, it is to be pointed out that historical
ballads, meant to be recited and not sung, are no
ballads at all in the communal sense.<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c012'><sup>[417]</sup></a> They are on the way
to epic, and no better study of this process can be made than
in the <i>Gest of Robin Hood</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>So much for the absence of any direct trace of personal
authorship in the ballad. It is strange to see critics going
everywhere to fetch a reason for this fact, except to the most
obvious place to find a reason,—in the singing and dancing
throng, where at least the elements of a ballad were made.
The subjective, the reflective, the sentimental, are characteristics
impossible in throng-made verse. Even now when
throngs are to be pleased, say in the modern drama, there is
a strange mixture of communal bustle and “situation” with
those sentimental ditties meant to touch the private heart.
Such a play is a monstrosity, to be sure, sheer anarchy of
art; but in its formless, purposeless racket it hits communal
taste and excites the Dionysian sense, until the crowd is shouting,
leaping, and singing by deputy. Going back, now, to
the active throng, and to the ballad which in many ways
represents that throng, let us see what communal elements
are to be noted in its diction, its form, and its surroundings.
The diction of a traditional ballad is spontaneous, simple,
objective as speech itself, and close to actual life. The course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>of artistic poetry, as was shown in the preceding chapter, is
away from simplicity of diction and toward a dialect. According
to the temper of the time, this dialect of poetry will be
broadly conventional, as with Waller, Dryden, and Pope, narrowly
conventional, as in the puzzle style of the Scandinavian
scaldic verse and in certain mannerisms of Tennyson, or
individual, as with Tennyson in his main style and with
Browning; but in any case it will be a good remove from the
speech of daily life. True, certain features of both primitive
and ballad poetry seem to make against this assertion. Dr.
Brinton<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c012'><sup>[418]</sup></a> says that all the American languages which he examined
had a poetic dialect apart from that of ordinary life;
but these records are clearly not of the communal type, not
spontaneous, but rather fossil forms and ceremonial rites.
Peasants in France, so Bujeaud notes, compose few ballads in
their <i>patois</i>; Hebel pointed out the same fact for German
song;<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c012'><sup>[419]</sup></a> and there is other evidence. But this is no objection
whatever to the theory of ballad simplicity; for as these
writers concede, peasants do make their improvised songs,
their couplets, <i>schnaderhüpfl</i>, <i>rundâs</i>, songs of labour, songs
of feasts, in their own dialect and in nothing else. The traditional
songs are often retained, as refrains or the like,
in incomprehensible or difficult phrase; but that is another
matter, and so far as one deals with communal elements, so
far one finds simple and everyday speech, entirely different
from the conventional or individual dialect of the poetry of art.
Lack of simplicity is held to be a proof of false pretences, of
forgery. More than this. The ballads lack figurative language
and tropes; they rarely change either the usual order
of words or the usual meaning. They lack not only antithesis,
but even the common figure of inversion,<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c012'><sup>[420]</sup></a> the figure which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>one would most expect to meet in ballad style. In the ballad
itself, inversion is vanishingly rare, and in the refrain,
significant fact, it is as good as unknown. Again, any wide
word, any mouth-filling phrase, even such a term as “fatherland,”
which opens a glimpse into the reaches of reflection
and inference, is alien to the ballad of the throng. Now it
is significant that this lack of tropes, characteristic of ballads
no less than their stanzaic form, sunders them from our old
recorded poetry; earliest English poetry is a succession of
metaphoric terms.<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c012'><sup>[421]</sup></a> All Germanic verse, in fact, laid main
stress upon the trope known as “kenning”; the ocean is the
“whale’s bath,” the “foaming fields,” the “sea-street”; a wife
is “the weaver of peace”; so, in endless variation, the poet
called object and action by as many startling names as he
could find in tradition or invent for himself.<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c012'><sup>[422]</sup></a> Like the
recurring phrase of the ballad, these are often conventional
terms; but they differ in quality from it by a world’s breadth.
For the mark of this trope, in its deliberate or conscious stage,<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c012'><sup>[423]</sup></a>
is a palpable effort of invention, a refusal to catch the nearest
way; the ballad is rarely figurative. What figures one does find
in it, and they are few enough, are unforced and almost unconscious.
As Steenstrup says, the Scandinavian ballad “talks
like a mother to her child,” and has “scarcely a kenning.”
Faroe and Icelandic ballads, to be sure, have a few kennings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>but they are not frequent. J. F. Campbell<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c012'><sup>[424]</sup></a> speaks of the
simple Gaelic ballads as poor in figures, while the epic made
from these lays riots in trope. The ballad hardly essays even
personal description.<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c012'><sup>[425]</sup></a> A modern Greek song ventures no
farther than the conventional comparison of the maiden with a
partridge; and no English ballad undertakes to give a picture
of the heroine,—only a traditional epithet or so. The heroes
are fair or ruddy, have yellow hair; and that is all. There
is no realism, as one now calls it. Minute description of
nature increases in direct ratio to the increasing individuality
of the poet; and one distrusts those German folksongs which
bring the sunset, or a fading leaf, or more subtle processes of
nature, into line with the singer’s feeling,—a trait of German
<i>minnesang</i>. One will search ballads in vain for a superb
touch like that word for the disturbing sunrise which Wolfram
puts into the watcher’s call to the lovers, “his claws
have struck through the clouds,”—as if a bird of prey to rob
them of their love;<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c012'><sup>[426]</sup></a> for in the ballads nature is a background
and rarely gets treatment in detail. Save in chronicle song
like the <i>Cheviot</i>, it is spring, summer, evening, it is the greenwood,
no more definite time or place; and so too it is bird or
beast, not a special kind, until conventional rose and lily
and deer and nightingale come to their monopoly. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>not communal verse, but poetry of art, which, without mythological
intent, transfers a distinctly human motive to nature,
as where Romeo sees those “envious streaks” in the east, or
where, in the <i>Béowulf</i>, old Hrothgar describes the abode of
Grendel, with that picture of the hounded stag, and with the
“weeping” sky. In the ballads, reference to nature is conventional,
though by no means insincere. Though the natural
setting is often an irrelevancy, as in <i>Lady Isabel</i>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There came a bird out o’ a bush</div>
      <div class='line in2'>On water for to dine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sighing sair, says the king’s daughter,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“O wae’s this heart of mine,”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>still, there are touches of nature, sincere and exquisite and
appropriate, to be found in sundry ballads, notably at the
opening of <i>Robin Hood and the Monk</i>.<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c012'><sup>[427]</sup></a> However, ballads are
mainly for the action, not the setting of the stage, and a
throng of festal dancers would not care for a bill of particulars.
It is the poet, fugitive from throngs, who turns to nature and
studies her charms with a lover’s scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, what ballads lack in figurative and
descriptive power, they supply in an excess of iteration, of
repetition, of fixed and recurring phrases. The recurring
phrase, along with the standing epithet, one finds, to be sure,
in the great epic as well as in the ballad of tradition; repetition
in the simpler sense, however, is peculiar to the ballads.
Epithets in the ballad are of a modest type; the steed is
“milk-white” or “berry-brown,” the lady is “free,”—that
is, “noble,”—while now and then an adjective cleaves to
its substantive in defiance of fact, as when the “true-love”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>is palpably false, or when the newborn infant is called an
“auld son.” As for the phrases, when a little foot-page
starts off with his message, when two swordsmen fall to
blows, when there are three horses, black, brown, and white,
to be tested, any reader of ballads can shut his eyes and
repeat the two or three conventional lines or even stanzas
that follow. Of course, as poetry grows artistic, recurring
phrases vanish; the artist shuns what is traditional and
evident, seeking to announce by independence and freshness
of phrase the individuality of his own art. Tobler notes that
while the more communal epic of old France used the same
terms and the same general apparatus for a fight here and
a fight there, Ariosto contrives, however one fight is like
another, to give an individual character to each.</p>

<p class='c013'>To say that these recurring phrases are due to the need of
the improvising singer for a halting-place, a rest, in order to
think of new material, is distortion of facts. Undoubtedly
the minstrel used these traditional passages for the purpose,
but they are due to the communal and public character of
the poetry itself, and belong, so far as the question of origins
is concerned, to that main fact in all primitive song, the fact
of iteration. This is now to be studied not so much in the
actual recurrence of identical passages, as in that characteristic
of ballad style which may be called incremental repetition.
One form of this is where a question is repeated along
with the answer, a process radically different from that of
Germanic epic, where the zeal for variation has blotted out
this primitive note of repetition, and, against all epic propriety,
forced a messenger to give his message in terms quite
different from the original. Again, each slight change in
the situation of a ballad often has a stanza which repeats
the preceding stanza exactly, save for a word or two to
express the change. Lyngbye<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c012'><sup>[428]</sup></a> found the Faroe ballads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>so laden with this kind of repetition that in the record he
omitted many of the stanzas, giving them all only here and
there, to show the general style. Side by side with incremental
repetition, which is usually found in sets of three
stanzas, runs a refrain, either repeated at the end of each
stanza or sung throughout as a burden. Moreover, with all
this iteration goes a tendency to omit particulars and events
which modern poetry would give in full, so that a very ill-natured
critic might define ballads as a combination of the
superfluous and the inadequate. But these traits can best be
seen in an actual ballad, <i>Babylon, or the Bonnie Banks of
Fordie</i>, familiar not only to Britain, but “to all branches of
the Scandinavian race.”<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c012'><sup>[429]</sup></a> It is an admirable specimen of communal
elements and traditional form blended with incipient
art:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The simple “plot” of this ballad might be wrought into a
long romance after the mediæval fashion, might be made
a modern drama, a modern short story,—Maupassant tells
something of the sort in a pathetic but repulsive sketch;
the manner of <i>Babylon</i>, however, is all its own, carrying one
miles from romance and drama and tale back into the communal
past. Two stanzas open with the ballad commonplaces,—ladies
in bower, the conventional summons of an outlaw
by breaking a branch, pulling a flower, or otherwise disturbing
the peace, and his appearance on the scene. Then
comes swift action; then the lingering, fascinating incremental
repetition; then the crash, and the leap into tragedy.
True, the sudden turns and the lack of connecting and explaining
passages are less marked than in other ballads, say
at the end of <i>Child Maurice</i>, where the almost bewildering
swiftness, the daring omission, roused Gray to enthusiasm
beyond his wont;<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c012'><sup>[435]</sup></a> but the trait is evident enough and
strong enough, even here, to show that one is far from the
garrulity of the romances,<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c012'><sup>[436]</sup></a> far from the forward-and-back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of a Germanic epic. It is not to be explained by any abbreviation
in the record. Zell long ago pointed out<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c012'><sup>[437]</sup></a> that
this habit of leapings and omissions is characteristic of what
may be regarded as the remains of Hellenic popular verse.
Like the ballad repetition, which is incremental, the ballad
omission is progressive, and has nothing of that strain and
doubling which makes Germanic epic, in Ten Brink’s phrase,
spend such a deal of movement without getting from the
spot. Yet it is chiefly in the incremental repetition that
the ballad shows its primitive habit as compared with the
merely retrospective repetition of the romances. The
ballad stands close to that spontaneous emotion which rises
in a throng and relieves itself in a common, obvious, often
repeated phrase; it stands close to the event, and hence
the abruptness, the process, due to sight at close quarters,
of immediate expression. The æsthetic value of repetition
is high when interest is held and concentrated upon a single
strong situation, as in <i>Babylon</i>; its value is low when the
action is a trivial sequence of details, as in a Russian ballad
quoted by Bistrom:<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c012'><sup>[438]</sup></a> “He set up his linen tent; when he
had set it up, he struck fire; when he had struck fire, he
kindled [the camp-fire]; when he had kindled, he cooked
the porridge; when he had cooked the porridge, he ate it:
when he had eaten it, he lay down,”—and so on, in the
strain dear to children.<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c012'><sup>[439]</sup></a> Another variety of incremental
repetition, which brings one closer to the conditions under
which ballads were made, is found in the account of Porthan<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c012'><sup>[440]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>about the singing of Finnish songs by a leader who improvises,
and a second singer, a sort of echo, a dwindled chorus,
who joins him and helps to carry the ballad along its way.
The leader<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c012'><sup>[441]</sup></a> sings a line; but before he comes to the end
of it, his partner catches the idea and joins him in the final
measure,<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c012'><sup>[442]</sup></a>—a word or two; then, while the other is silent,
this helper repeats the whole line, often with a slight change
of words, mainly an adverb or the like thrown in,—“surely,”
“in truth,”—and with an even slighter change of tone; then
the leader sings another verse, the helper falls in, repeats,
and so to the end of the song. The two sit face to face with
clasped hands, and round them are the people <i>arrectis auribus</i>.
It is fair to conjecture that the folk were not always silent
hearers, and that the helper is deputy of a choral throng
which has come to silence in the enjoyment of a superior
art;<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c012'><sup>[443]</sup></a> Porthan admits that all sorts and conditions of Finns
were once able to make these ballads, and he goes on to tell
of the universal custom of the women to improvise little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>songs as they grind at the hand-mills. The trick of singing
in pairs is not uncommon, and is seen elsewhere upon a
historical background of choral song; Castrén says that
the Samoyedes improvise their magic songs in the same
fashion, a conjurer of the first class beginning the verse,
and joined in the final words by the humbler shaman, who
then repeats the whole alone. The song consists of but a
few words.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c012'><sup>[444]</sup></a> Similar methods, on a higher plane, are found
in Denmark and Iceland. Ethnological evidence, too, is
at hand; in Africa, Captain Clapperton heard two singers
sing an artless ballad, one doing the verses, the other the
refrain.<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c012'><sup>[445]</sup></a> Often two dancers lead a dance.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c012'><sup>[446]</sup></a> It is only a
step, moreover, from the twain with clasped hands, to the
two singers of a flyting, Eskimo song duels, strife between
Summer and Winter, amœbean verse of all kinds; see, for
example, the Carlin and little boy in the Swedish ballad, or
Harpkin and Fin in the English,<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c012'><sup>[447]</sup></a> where one verse suggests
the reply in the next. From these to the <i>schnaderhüpfl</i>,
when one after another steps out and sings, and so back
to the chorus, as in Lyngbye’s case of the Faroe fisher, is
but another easy inference; in short, it is clear, by overwhelming
proof, that the individual performers are a survival
of the singing, dancing throng with its infinite repetitions
and its unending refrain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still another form of incremental repetition will occur to
the reader as based on old custom but bare of all save the
rawest æsthetic ministrations, and nowadays used only for
jocose ends. The same line or stanza is sung indefinitely,
with the use of a new name, number, fact, in each repetition;
or else the repetition is cumulative, a test of memory, somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>as in “The House that Jack Built.”<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c012'><sup>[448]</sup></a> There is a German
student song, still popular, where the names of those present
are rimed, one after the other, into a fixed formula; while
degenerate and silly verses of one’s youth, nursery songs,<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c012'><sup>[449]</sup></a>
counting-out rimes and the like, will occur to one by the
dozen, and seem less negligible, get, indeed, an æsthetic lift,
when one finds in them distinct hints of some old incantation,
some choral song to bless house and field, as well as echoes
from the dance and the labour of primitive man. Counting-out
rimes in Germany are often epic,<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c012'><sup>[450]</sup></a> with a spice of adventure,
thus working into ballad territory; and these, as with
children’s games at large, hold to the dance. F. Wolf
sunders the dramatic dances of the Catalan peasantry, with
lives of saints, battle of Christian and Moor, robber tales, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>so on, as their theme, the work of professional singers, from
those simple dances of the country folk and of the children,
some of which are of the type now under discussion. He
gives<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c012'><sup>[451]</sup></a> a pretty little incremental specimen of this latter sort.
But labour is also in the game. In Gottschee<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c012'><sup>[452]</sup></a> there is a ballad
of a servant maid who served one year and earned a chicken;
chicken hatched chickens: served second year and earned
a duck; duck stands on big, wide feet, chicken hatches
chickens: served a third year and earned a turkey; turkey
said <i>Long Ears</i>, duck stands, and so on: and then lamb, kid,
pig, calf, pony, little man (the husband) who says <i>Love Me</i>,
and finally “a youngster” who says <i>Weigh Me</i>,—and then
back through it all to the chicken. This is sung of course by
the girl; but from the cumulative song, with more or less
refrain, it is an easy step to the choral song of labour, which
is naturally incremental. Such is the song<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c012'><sup>[453]</sup></a> of women weeding
the millet, which combines the old refrain of labour in
the field with the incremental repetition of a hardly coherent
ballad. Prettier is that song<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c012'><sup>[454]</sup></a> which the playmates of a bride
sing during the weaving of her bridal wreath.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To-day a maiden has been joyous,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Joyous she now nevermore;</div>
      <div class='line'>Joyous surely she shall yet be,—</div>
      <div class='line'>But as maiden nevermore.</div>

      <div class='line'>Hand them shall she surely yet,—</div>
      <div class='line'>But as maiden nevermore.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The third stanza simply puts “binding” for “handing.”
Here is the incremental repetition along with the fixed
refrain,—not a very difficult communal feat, by the way,
and, as in all these cases, getting its rhythm from the work
or the dance, its meaning from the event or deed in hand.
So, too, when the bride goes away, she is again besung, and
the events are occasion of the quite contemporary words;
thus, as she is lifted upon the husband’s horse,-</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>She is seated, she has sobbed!</div>
      <div class='line'>She has ridden away, she laughed!<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c012'><sup>[456]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The better known collections are full of these simple cumulative
songs, which it would be superfluous to record. In
Algeria women sing an endless song of the sort with fixed
refrain and incremental stanza. A combination of the counting-out
rime and the song of labour is found in many places,
for example, a Gascon ballad<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c012'><sup>[457]</sup></a> sung by women as they wash
clothes and beat the linen in cadence; the feature of dropping
a number with each new stanza reminds one of those
<i>Ten Little Indians</i> of one’s youth:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Nine are washing the lye,</div>

      <div class='line in4'>Pretty Marion,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Let us to the fountain go.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Then “eight are washing,” then seven, and so on, one woman
dropping out at each break. Again, soldiers on the march
sing the interminable song of increments with a refrain:<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c012'><sup>[458]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ma poule a fait deux poulets ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Bücher<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c012'><sup>[459]</sup></a> traces all these marching songs back to a primitive
form such as one still hears in Africa, where “for hours at a
time” the natives on the march keep singing a half-dozen
words or phrases in monotonous repetition, and with no increments.
The development hence through incremental stanzas
up to the Tyrtæan lyric of battle, verses of the <i>Chanson de
Roland</i>, and so on, is evident enough. Repetition of the incremental
and cumulative sorts, moreover, is easily connected
with religious rites. “It seems a fair inference,” says Mr. E. B.
Tylor,<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c012'><sup>[460]</sup></a> “to think folklore nearest its source where it has its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>highest place and meaning.” At the end of the book of Passover
services used by modern Jews, as Mr. Tylor and others
have noted, there is a poem which curiously resembles the
nursery tale of the old woman and her pig; the angel of
death is dignified enough, and is slain by the Holy One, but
cat eating kid, dog biting cat, and so on, are something ludicrous.
Mr. Tylor thinks all this the original of the nursery
tale itself. Again, in the same book there is a solemn counting
poem; one is God, two are the tables of the covenant, and
so on up to thirteen, when all is reversed in order back to
one. Watchmen’s songs counting the hours will occur to
every reader. Germanic heathendom, doubtless, had this
counting song in its ceremonial rites;<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c012'><sup>[461]</sup></a> while incremental
repetition in the charms, that oldest form of recorded poetry,
is often found, witness the highly interesting charm against
a stitch in the side, or rheumatism, from an English manuscript
of the tenth century;<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c012'><sup>[462]</sup></a> here are not only the recurring
line of incantation, and the epic opening usual in charms, but
a trace of something like the repetition with increments:
“There sat a smith and made a knife,” and again, “six
smiths were sitting, warspears working;” why not <i>caetera
desunt</i>?</p>

<p class='c013'>Repetition is not an invention and grace of artistic poetry,
as the books are fond of saying; it is the most characteristic
legacy, barring rhythm, which communal conditions have
made to art. Its artistic expression, in which, to borrow
Emerson’s phrase, it comes back to the passive throng “with
a certain alienated majesty,” no longer the simple iteration of
a refrain or an incremental ballad, takes noblest form in tragedy
and monody, shading down into artifice, however effective,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>in Maeterlinck’s <i>Princesse Maleine</i> and <i>Pelleas et Mélisande</i><a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c012'><sup>[463]</sup></a>
where it almost makes rhythm of the prose, and into
clever but legitimate tricks in Molière’s famous <i>galère</i> passage
and in his other passage, almost as famous, of the <i>sans dot</i>.
It is used to give simple effects; probably it constitutes the
charm of Hiawatha, as well as of that imitated ballad by
Hamilton, the <i>Braes of Yarrow</i>, which Pinkerton ill-naturedly
called “an eternal jingle.” We may therefore divide poetic
iteration into two great classes,—one natural or primitive,
which is as much as to say communal, the other artistic, with
a No Man’s Land or Siberia whither one banishes the artificial.
This artificial iteration of poetic style is perhaps nowhere so
insistent as in those interesting but exasperating oddities
known as <i>Greenes Funeralls</i>,<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c012'><sup>[464]</sup></a> published “contrarie to the
author’s expectation.” Of course, the step from art to artifice
is not too obvious. Every one knows the smoothness, the
fluidity, as Arnold calls it, which Spenser gave to his verse,
often by this delicately managed iteration—say in <i>Astrophel</i>;<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c012'><sup>[465]</sup></a>
Donne softens his roughness with it in many a poem; but it
becomes a tiresome trick at R. B.’s hands:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ah, could my Muse old Maltaes Poet passe</div>

      <div class='line in2'>In shining brasse for all the world to show it,<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c012'><sup>[466]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>and it grows worse than tiresome in Gabriel Harvey’s variation
of the <i>ubi sunt</i> theme:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ah, that Sir Humphrey Gilbert should be dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah, that Sir Philip Sidney should be dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah, that Sir William Sakevil should be dead,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>which is not even humorous. Now it is clear that classical
models play a part here. The pastorals of Vergil, the iteration
of elegy imitated by Milton at the opening of <i>Lycidas</i>,
are to be reckoned with; but not only was the throng behind
all this, as shall be seen in a study of the <i>vocero</i>, not only are
the charming iterations and incremental touches in Catullus,<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c012'><sup>[467]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

      <div class='line'>nulli illum pueri, nullae optauere puellae ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>along with store of ordinary repetition and a refrain, to be
placed where they belong, in an alternating chorus of youths
and maidens, with distinctly communal background; but
there were cases in early English where the classical influence
is slight, and the song of a swaying mass is clearly to
be heard:<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c012'><sup>[468]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Adam lay ibowndyn, bowndyn in a bond,</div>

      <div class='line'>Ne hadde neuer our lady aben heauene qwen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In fact, early literature is full of repetition which suggests a
recent transfer from the dancing and singing throng. So
even the mediæval clerk<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c012'><sup>[469]</sup></a> had not only Latin jingling in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>head, but also songs of the country folk buzzing in his ears;
and it is no classical tone, despite the tongue, that sounds in
his—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>veni, veni, venias,</div>
      <div class='line'>ne me mori facias,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>while repetition takes a more artistic form in the vernacular:<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c012'><sup>[470]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>Come and make me well again,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lips so sweet of red-rose grain!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Incremental repetition, then, as it is found in traditional
ballads, lies midway between two extremes, one communal
and one artistic. Behind it is the indefinite iteration, unchanged,
of primitive song; before it is the repetition of
artistic parallelism which is crossed by variation, mainspring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>of the poetic dialect. Iteration is the spontaneous expression
of emotion, and begins in the throng; it lies at the root of all
rhythm, cadence, and consent; variation is the assertion of
art, of progress, of the individual. These are the two great
elements of poetry. Variation could take place in two ways.
The communal singer had his stock of communal refrains
and the like, derived from tradition of the singing and dancing
throng; for communal purposes he could have added his
own stanzas, just as Burns did in modern days. There was
the chorus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Bonnie lassie, will ye go,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Will ye go, will ye go,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bonnie lassie, will ye go</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To the birks of Aberfeldy?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>To this, and many a chorus like it, Burns added his own
words.<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c012'><sup>[471]</sup></a> But the early artists who worked out the scheme
of national poetry went about their task by a different
method. Their material was the unchanged repetition, probably
in couplets corresponding to the forward-and-back of a
dance, either in line, like some children’s games now, or in a
half circle, like that dance of the Botocudos. Out of this
repetition they made the artistic parallelism found alike in
Germanic epic and in Hebrew psalms, as well as the variation
which Heinzel has so neatly compared for this same
epic and for the Sanskrit hymn. As regards Germanic verse,
Dr. R. M. Meyer<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c012'><sup>[472]</sup></a> notes that repetition of words yielded to
the necessity, imposed by rigid metrical law, to take a synonym
which would rime with the principal word, thus ending
in a mass of kennings or verbal variations. It is clear that
the strophic ballad is based upon older conditions, as is proved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>by preceding examples, and by the lack of variation in typical
verses such as this, the opening of a pretty dance-song:<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c012'><sup>[473]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>La rauschen, lieb, la rauschen!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The rigid structure of an alliterative verse calls for variation,
not repetition, within its limits; variation in the ballads is
incremental and close to actual repetition, being forced within
a stanza only by the exigencies of rime:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O where hae ye been, <i>Lord Randal, my son</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>O where hae ye been, <i>my handsome young man</i>?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The refrain, however, could hold to repetition pure and
simple, leaving room for an increment of considerable effect
at the climax; thus in the same ballad of <i>Lord Randal</i>, the
refrain</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For I’m weary wi’ hunting and fain wad lie down,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>turns at the end to—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For I’m sick at the heart and I fain wad lie down.<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c012'><sup>[474]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Doubtless, too, variation began in the singing before it was
evident in the record; that change of accent which editors
claim for the well-known verses:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sigh nó more, ládies, sigh no móre...</div>
      <div class='line'>Weep nó more, wóeful shépherds, wéep no móre</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>may have had its counterpart in far older and far ruder
verse of the throng. If the earliest form of poetry was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>iterated single verse, a statement of a fact, or, in the first
instance, a fact stated not formally but by the repetition of
words in a rhythmic period which was itself exactly repeated,
it is clear that the progress of poesy may have begun by
making a proposition of the single verse and then proceeding
to add some new elements in the repetition of it. Artistic
skill next fell upon the single verse,<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c012'><sup>[475]</sup></a> fixed its cadence,
curbed its repetition by syntactic relations, and, as in Germanic
poetry, rang the changes on this law of variation.
Now it is evident beyond all doubt how great a part incremental
repetition must have played, and it is also evident
that this can be studied best in a collocation of communal
survivals, like the ballads, and primitive survivals, such as are
found in savage songs. Let us look first at certain songs
which belong between these two classes, then at a form of
verse which is found in both, and finally at the ethnological
or primitive material.</p>

<p class='c013'>Radloff<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c012'><sup>[476]</sup></a> collected an admirable series of songs and ballads
in southern Siberia. Here are the homogeneous community,
the oral and traditional verse, and the slow but sure ruin<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c012'><sup>[477]</sup></a> of
both due to importation of Mahometan learning, books and
poets; here too are those fashions of making and keeping a
song, half communal, half artistic, which yield to the conditions
of written poetry. The gregarious song still lingers
in chorus and in improvisations; while individual singers are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>working free from the throng, and are diverting the old broad
current of repetition into channels and courses of art. But
this individual artist<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c012'><sup>[478]</sup></a> has a very short tether, and he is close
to the community not only in fact but in the character of his
work. Improvisation is the rule; composition of the deliberate
modern sort is almost unknown. Festal throngs, not a
poet’s solitude, are the birthplace of poetry; and the folk, if
they must listen and may not sing in chorus, choose a pair of
singers to compete. “Some one present steps forward and
challenges to a flyting. If no one appears in answer, the
challenger sings improvised stanzas making fun of the people
before him; but if a match is made up, then the two wage
their duel in song until one fails to respond, loses the game,
and gives a present to his conqueror.” As with the Faroe
islanders, so here on the Tartar steppes, and on the slopes
of the Altai, if these rival songs show conspicuous merit,
they are remembered, repeated, and sung as traditional
ballads.<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c012'><sup>[479]</sup></a> Radloff has several instances. A girl who enters
such a flyting with a young man named Kosha, now flouts, now
praises, and finally—another world-old trick of traditional
song—falls into a series of riddles. What was first created,—who
was so-and-so’s father,<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c012'><sup>[480]</sup></a>—when do the waters freeze?
Kosha answers them all; the girl gives up, and presents him
with a coat. Another pretty flyting<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c012'><sup>[481]</sup></a> is also between youth
and maid; the girl holds her own until the boy says he has
wounded her brother, whereupon she sits down and weeps.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>In all these, and in the solitary improvisations, there is constant
repetition. Two verses of a challenge—all go by
quatrains—are repeated in the answer; while in the continuous
ballad, song oscillates, as Ten Brink says of this stage
in the development of poetry, between memory and improvisation,
production and reproduction. The singer has a mass of
verses in his head, and puts his own thought only into the
third and fourth lines of a quatrain,<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c012'><sup>[482]</sup></a> the first and second
coming from the common stock. That is the recurrent
passage, the “ballad slang”; but actual repetition, in its
incremental phase, is stronger here than in any poetry on
record except that of the Finns. A fine example of this
repetition and variation is in the <i>Kangsa Pi</i>, one of the
historic songs;<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c012'><sup>[483]</sup></a> mostly the stanzas are interlaced in pairs.
Often the changes are mere emphasis, not progress; for
example:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>If I had a white hawk,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He would scream behind me;</div>
      <div class='line'>If I had relatives on my father’s side,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They would follow behind me.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>If I had a blue hawk.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He would scream behind me;</div>
      <div class='line'>If I had relatives on the Old One’s side,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They would follow behind me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>These changes of colour, variation on hard-and-fast lines,
are very frequent and often inappropriate, as with a white
horse and a blue horse;<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c012'><sup>[484]</sup></a> one form of the change is not far
remote from a Germanic kenning:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>O Myrat mine, Myrat mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>A <i>sea</i> is coming,—</div>
      <div class='line'>How will you cross it?</div>
      <div class='line'>On its <i>border</i> dwells a tribe,—</div>
      <div class='line'>How will you come through it?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O Myrat mine, Myrat mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>A <i>stretch of water</i> is coming,—</div>
      <div class='line'>How will you cross it?</div>
      <div class='line'>On its <i>banks</i> dwells a tribe,—</div>
      <div class='line'>How will you come through it?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Thus a mother to her son; his answer is of the same kind;
and so back and forth for nineteen stanzas, when the poem
closes with two stanzas sung by the son happily returned
from war. With this parallelism of form goes a parallelism
of thought not unlike the implied simile in poetry of the
schools; witness the hawk and the relatives, quoted just
above, or these improvised verses:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What has scattered the golden-seeming leaves?</div>
      <div class='line'>Is it the white birch? It is indeed!</div>
      <div class='line'>She whose hair streams down her back,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is it my wife? It is indeed!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What has scattered the silver-seeming leaves?</div>
      <div class='line'>Is it the blue birch? It is indeed!</div>
      <div class='line'>She whose hair streams down her neck,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is it my betrothed? It is indeed!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This is growing a bit too artistic for comfort; and presently
in another song direct simile breaks out:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As the meadow fire in spring,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Warms this heart of mine;</div>
      <div class='line'>As the bird that comes in spring,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Implores this eye of mine.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As the fire that burns in autumn,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Burns this heart of mine;</div>
      <div class='line'>As the bird that comes in autumn,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Mourns this eye of mine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Improvised or not, these songs are not only of the individual
lover, but of the artist, the bard, still close to his throng, to
be sure, but with a clear notion of his dignity and a good
care for his singing-robes. As one of these bards, though
in another tribe,<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c012'><sup>[485]</sup></a> prettily puts it:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When the wind blows from the right hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bends and bows the poplar;</div>
      <div class='line'>When I sit and sing,</div>
      <div class='line'>May there follow thirty songs!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When the wind blows from the left hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>May the poplar move and quiver!</div>
      <div class='line'>When I thus sit and sing,</div>
      <div class='line'>May my own breast move and quiver!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Presently pen and paper will be found for the singer, and at
last printer’s ink to spread his songs; the days of communal
chorus and communal repetition are numbered. One other
effect of the old communal impulse, however, may be noted
along with this trick of style. The rhapsode, singer, leader,
where he is first seen detaching himself from the throng, has
neither the individuality nor the artistic importance of what
one now calls a poet. Every one knows the solicitude of
Germanic singers to base their song upon tradition, to put
their own invention into the background and appeal to the
common stock: “we have heard tell of the Spear-Danes,”—“I
heard tell of Hildebrand and Hathubrand.” This
meant that the tale to be told had the communal stamp, and
was worth hearing.<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c012'><sup>[486]</sup></a> Egger<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c012'><sup>[487]</sup></a> notes that the oldest Greek
rhapsodes, like their songs, differed not one from the other
in glory; the best song was simply the last which had been
heard,<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c012'><sup>[488]</sup></a> and there was no trace of rivalry among the bards, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>trace of partiality among the hearers. With the next age,
the time of Hesiod, came the stress and struggle for a poet’s
crown; and since the crown was to be awarded to the best
singer, judges were in demand, and so a rough criticism. It
is easy to see that this stage would be reached in any growth
of poetry when the bard began to talk of his thirty songs
and of his quivering bosom; behind that stage lies the stage
of the poets as deputies and mouthpieces of the throng;
behind that, the throng itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have now to look at a second class of material where
primitive repetition, born of strong communal emotion, gets
artistic control and so passes into new phases of development;
this, confined to no one epoch of culture, must be
sought in some universal human impulse. Birth, marriage,
death, ought to give rise to such songs. Obviously, however,
the first of these will be of the least value, and in point of
fact songs of the sort were rarely recorded in early times,
and perhaps rarely if ever made. Marriage and death, from
the terms of the case, promise far better; and of the two,—for
to treat them both would demand excessive space,—we
shall take the songs of death, the <i>voceri</i>.<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c012'><sup>[489]</sup></a> A brief glance at
the marriage-songs, however, which are mainly sung in communal
dance and procession, shows repetition everywhere, increasing
with the older stages of culture. In German villages
the whole community still has a share in the bridal;<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c012'><sup>[490]</sup></a> while
in Tyrol, if a girl goes outside the village for a husband, the
youths mob her, tie her to a dung-cart, and lead her through the
place, all singing derisive songs, until her father rescues her.<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c012'><sup>[491]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Of course, the mobbing of unchaste women who marry
is common enough; while in other cases of local indignation,
crowds and derisive songs are always in order,<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c012'><sup>[492]</sup></a> being
represented under conditions of print by the “ballad,”
which can be used as a threat, like the modern reporter’s
interview or “exposure.” Gretchen, in her terror, seems
to hear these mocking songs. Poor Pamela hoped she
would “not be the subject of their ballads and elegies,” if
she put an end to herself. But this is the other side of a
joyous page. The later epithalamy was sung on private
family occasions outside the bridal chamber and Puttenham
gives a lively description of such festivities; but public and
communal features are the older fact. In Greece<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c012'><sup>[493]</sup></a> the
bridal song comes from the festal crowd and accompanies
the communal dance; the bride throws bits of food into the
village fountain, about which the dances begin,—dances
“which are regarded as the last act of the wedding ceremony.”
The songs for these dances, moreover, along with
verses composed and danced at other stages of the affair,
“form a considerable part of the national poetry.”<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c012'><sup>[494]</sup></a> In
Albania<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c012'><sup>[495]</sup></a> the bridal bread is baked on Thursday, and the
kneading of it is begun with choral songs made for the occasion;
on Sunday the marriage takes place, and from the
procession of the groom and his friends down to the departure
of the pair all is song and dance. The formal dance is
opened by bride and groom, when a song is sung: “Raven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>stole a partridge.—Partridge? What will he do with the
partridge?—Play with her, toy with her, and spend his life
with her.” English marriage customs, with communal dance
and song, were of the same sort;<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c012'><sup>[496]</sup></a> and “the poore Bryde”
had to “kepe foote with al dauncers and refuse none, how
scabbed, foule, droncken, rude and shamles soever he be,”—an
early puritan view of the case. Song and dance, communal
rites throughout, were certainly characteristic of the
Germanic wedding in its old estate, as is proved by divers
names cited by Müllenhoff in his essay on our old choral
verse,<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c012'><sup>[497]</sup></a> and by the fact that a wedding was often called outright
“the bridal song.”<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c012'><sup>[498]</sup></a> Neocorus,<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c012'><sup>[499]</sup></a> too, tells of the customs
in his time among the folk of the Cimbrian peninsula.
In the East, again, down to this day, a wedding, like a
funeral, is celebrated by the entire village for a full week;
it was on communal epithalamies of the sort that one
based the artistic bridal poem such as Budde<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c012'><sup>[500]</sup></a> sees in Solomon’s
Song. The modern custom is said to keep many
primitive traits. After a wedding,<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c012'><sup>[501]</sup></a> which is usually in March,
the pair are treated for seven days “as king and queen,”
and songs, now of communal victory and the like, now
erotic, are sung by the folk; a great dance, moreover, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>danced to the <i>wasf</i>, a song which praises the charms of
bridegroom and bride. The chorus is naturally insistent
and incessant, and a main characteristic of the songs is
repetition.<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c012'><sup>[502]</sup></a> But all folksong of the wedding tells this tale
of dance and song, with repetition as the chief feature of
the poetical style; and repetition is studied to even better
advantage in that communal song of lamentation for the
dead, which, for convenience, may pass by its Corsican
name of <i>vocero</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mourners for the dead, now, save in the case of public
characters, restricted to kin and friends, but once the whole
community, are only mutes or audience to the act of burial;
it is clear, however, that the priest and the service, or, as in
France, the oration at the grave, along with the reticent
group, are deputy for older and indeed still surviving songs
of lament improvised and uttered by a near relative, and
these again are but a development from the rhythmic wailings
of a whole community or clan. Antiquity is no test
whatever. A husband who advances to the coffin where
his dead wife is lying and gives her a passionate farewell,
after the manner of the French, while the funeral guests
stand now in sympathetic silence, now with audible manifestations
of grief, is doing precisely what Lucian describes as
common in his day, barring the extravagance of the previous
scene and the violent demonstrations made by Grecian
women. Lucian thinks both demonstrations and oration
ridiculous,<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c012'><sup>[503]</sup></a> and he gives a kind of parody of the speech
which a father makes over the body of his son. So too with
the poetical lament, the elegy, mere antiquity goes for
nothing; and the question is one of stages of evolution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>regardless of chronology, from the communal and choral
wail up to the highly individualized and intellectualized
monody of grief. The elegy of Simonides over the dead
at Marathon was doubtless in its way as artistic as Tennyson’s
<i>Ode on Wellington</i>; and the same perspective must be kept
in dealing with private outbursts of sorrow. Tennyson’s
own lines on the death of his brother are not a whit more
modern in tone than the <i>Ave atque Vale</i> of Catullus which
inspired them. The more primitive obligation was not to
hear in respectful sympathy, not to read with intellectual
approval, the oration or the poem, but to weep with them
that weep and so to sing with them that sing. Uhland<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c012'><sup>[504]</sup></a>
cleverly notes the mythological projection of this older
custom in that lament for Balder shared by all animate and
inanimate creation. We are not, however, to think of the <i>vocero</i>
as sprung from the ceremonies of a primitive funeral. Historians
of literature are fond of such a process, and fix upon
this or that religious rite as the source of some poem or song;
Kögel,<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c012'><sup>[505]</sup></a> for example, traces epic to a ceremonial rite as to its
ultimate origin, and, for this particular case, insists that
the <i>vocero</i> of a Germanic wife over her husband was a song
of magic, a kind of incantation, asserting, wildly enough,
that choral lament for the dead was unknown to the Germans
of Tacitus, while magic songs had long been in vogue. This
is distortion of facts and reversal of natural evolution. By
the very terms of social organization, social consent must
precede social institutions, and a ceremonial must usually
be regarded not as the beginning but as the end of a social
process. The prime factor in social expression was consent
of rhythm; rhythmic cries at wedding<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c012'><sup>[506]</sup></a> and at funeral do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>not spring from the religious rites, although this or that
wedding-song, this or that threnody, may have had such an
origin; the rites are rather themselves an outcome, under
priestly control and the hardening of custom into law, of
this festal excitement, this communal grief. The priest,
even the shaman, is deputy of that throng which was once
active and is now passive; and when one considers the
literature of death, one finds the earliest stages of funeral
lament in that half chaotic chorus of repetition and tumultuous
cries which cannot be derived from any ceremony,
strictly so called, but is rather on the way to ceremony. At
this literature we are now to look.</p>

<p class='c013'>Homer has preserved in an artistic form echoes of primitive
wailing, of primitive repetition and choral cries, when he
describes the funeral of Hector.<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c012'><sup>[507]</sup></a> “And the others ...
laid him on a fretted bed, and set beside him minstrels,
leaders of the dirge, who wailed a mournful lay, while the
women made moan with them.” Andromache then leads
the lamentation, “while in her hands she held the head of
Hector, slayer of men. ‘Husband, thou art gone young
from life.’ ... Thus spake she wailing, and the women
joined their moan.” Then Hecuba; and again the line like
a refrain, “Thus spake she wailing, and stirred unending
moan.” Lastly Helen; and again, “Thus spake she wailing,
and therewith the great multitude of the people groaned.”
Wailings of the throng are echoed also in choruses of Greek
tragedy;<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c012'><sup>[508]</sup></a> but it is these epic passages and their details which
carry one back into the communal realm, quite away from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>the satire of Lucian,<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c012'><sup>[509]</sup></a> however some of the features which he
describes may seem to be repeated here. The song of lament,
whether a domestic duty or a professional act, was mainly a
matter for the women, and was originally improvised; at the
funeral of Achilles,<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c012'><sup>[510]</sup></a> it is his mother and “the deathless
maidens of the waters” who wail about his pyre, and it is the
muses themselves who raise the clear chant. So Hildeburh
at the funeral pile, in that episode of the <i>Béowulf</i>:<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c012'><sup>[511]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sad at his shoulder sorrowed the woman,</div>
      <div class='line'>Moaned him in songs.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>That a wailing chorus answered her wailing there can be no
doubt, though nothing is said of it; that the song is not
quoted, that the record of these rites is brief, can be explained
easily enough, when one remembers the monk who set down
this fine old epic with pagan delight in his heart but a crucifix
before his eyes, and constant thunder of ecclesiastical denunciation
in his ears. Those <i>neniae inhonestae</i>, the singing of
diabolical songs and the dancing of diabolical dances<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c012'><sup>[512]</sup></a> about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>a corpse, all the “payens corsed olde rites,” were denounced
by bishops and councils of the church with a fervid iteration
which at once accounts for the silence of the poets and
testifies to the stubborn vogue of the ceremony. The dance
is of course a survival of very primitive rites, as will be seen
in the study of the actual <i>vocero</i>, and as can be learned from
ethnology; for the epics it has been developed into funeral
games, although in the <i>Béowulf</i> one finds an older stage of
these ceremonies than in Homer. Besides Hrothgar’s lament
over Aeschere, a lament intensified by the absence of the dead
body,<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c012'><sup>[513]</sup></a> and the moanings of old Hrethel for his son,<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c012'><sup>[514]</sup></a> there is
the hero’s own funeral, where, when all the clan, presumably,
have mourned their lord, presumably in song, and when the
wife has sung, like Hildeburh, her <i>giomorgyd</i>, her song of
lamentation, at last the ashes are placed in the barrow, and
twelve noble youths ride round it chanting the praises of the
dead king. A close parallel to this ceremony is found far to
the eastward. In what is now known to have been a Gothic
rather than a Hunnish rite, warriors rode, “as in the games of
the circus,” round the body of Attila where he lay in state,
and as they rode sang also a funeral song of praise; Jordanis<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c012'><sup>[515]</sup></a>
gives a Latin version of it, but as it stands in this
guise, it has a very artistic and even artificial ring. The clan-grief
and the clan-praise at Beowulf’s funeral are nearer to
the facts. As regards the riding, it is clear that this takes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>place of an older dance or march, just as the song takes the
place of older wailings and cries. The processions of a whole
community, at times of planting and of harvest, round the
field, the barn, the village, to which we shall presently refer
when considering the refrain, are matched by similar rites
of marching with dance and song round hearth, grave, altar,
in the ceremonies of wedding and burial. On the Isle of
Man a wedding party goes three times round the church
before it enters; and in many places the corpse is carried in
the same way for a funeral. In the latter case, the solemn
march is only a repetition of the dance round the corpse
itself, the mourners going hand in hand, now slowly, now
tumultuously, to the sound of their own wailing. Ethnological
evidence, again, puts the songs and dances for the dead, as
found among savage tribes throughout the world, in line
with these survivals among the peasantry of Europe; no
chain of evidence could be more complete. To this ethnological
material we shall presently return; meanwhile it is in
order to note the evidence in literature.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have seen obvious cases of the <i>vocero</i> in oldest English,
and it could be followed in other Germanic records. Probably
many of the English and Scottish ballads began as a kind of
<i>vocero</i>, something like the coronach of Highland clans: one
thinks of <i>Bonny George Campbell</i>, with its repetition and
refrain, and of <i>The Bonny Earl of Murray</i>, with its triad of
incremental repetitions, ballads which follow close upon the
death of their hero; of ballads less immediate but still memorial,
like <i>The Baron of Brackley</i>, and perhaps <i>The Lowlands of
Holland</i>; even of the widely spread ballads of a condemned
criminal, the <i>Good Nights</i>, and such admirable precipitates of
this kind as <i>Mary Hamilton</i>. For more direct evidence, the
refrain line <i>Ohon for my son Leesome Brand!</i><a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c012'><sup>[516]</sup></a> is promising;
but it is only a line. One <i>vocero</i>, however, has come down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>to us, although considerably changed from the normal and
original pattern. In Aubrey’s <i>Remains of Gentilisme and
Judaisme</i>,<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c012'><sup>[517]</sup></a> mention is made of “Irish howlings at Funeralls,
<i>also in Yorkshire within these 70 yeares</i> (1688)”; and again,
quoting the song, <i>This can night</i>, Aubrey says it is from Mr.
Mawtese, “in whose father’s youth, sc. about sixty years
since (now 1686), at country vulgar Funeralls was sung this
song,” by a woman like a <i>praefica</i>. Scott has a like account;
it was sung a century ago<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c012'><sup>[518]</sup></a> “by the lower ranks of Roman
Catholics in some parts of the north of England. The tune
is doleful and monotonous.” The refrain, or, as Scott calls it,
the chorus, is very insistent and belongs to genuine communal
tradition; he quotes an account of Cleveland, Yorkshire, in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, which was found by Ritson in
a manuscript of the Cotton library: “When any dieth, certaine
women sing a song to the dead bodie, recyting the
journey that the partye deceased must goe.” The following
stanzas will serve as specimens of this highly developed but
interesting <i>vocero</i>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>This ae nighte, this ae nighte,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Every night and alle</i>;</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In Germany, the <i>vocero</i> lingered long, but is dying or dead;
it was an improvised farewell in “free” rhythm.<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c012'><sup>[519]</sup></a> A very
interesting communal survival akin to the <i>vocero</i> was known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>in Flanders down to the year 1840,—The Maids’ Dance<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c012'><sup>[520]</sup></a> at
the funeral of a companion; it was sung and danced by the
young girls of the parish. When the coffin had been lowered
into the grave, all these girls, holding by one hand the cloth
which had covered the corpse, went back to the church singing
this “dance” with a force and a rhythmic accent which
roused the hearer’s surprise.<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c012'><sup>[521]</sup></a> The two stanzas and the refrain
are, of course, partly modern; but they show traces of the old
dance and <i>vocero</i> noted below as surviving among the Corsicans:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Up in heaven is a dance;</div>
      <div class='line in8'><i>Alleluia</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>There the maidens are dancing all.</div>
      <div class='line in6'><i>Benedicamus Domino.</i></div>
      <div class='line in6'><i>Alleluia, Alleluia.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It is for Amelia;</div>
      <div class='line in8'><i>Alleluia</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>We’re dancing as the maidens dance.</div>
      <div class='line in6'><i>Benedicamus Domino.</i></div>
      <div class='line in6'><i>Alleluia, Alleluia.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But there is better material in the literature of other races.
Nowhere, for example, is the wailing and chanting of women
over the dead better attested than among the Hebrews of the
Old Testament; Syrians of to-day hold to the same rites and
sing a song of mourning strangely like that which Jeremiah
heard twenty-five centuries ago.<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c012'><sup>[522]</sup></a> The lament of David over
Saul and Jonathan, known to be an actual <i>kîna</i>, with its personal
touch of “my brother,” and its communal refrain, <i>how</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span><i>are the mighty fallen</i>, differs from the professional lamentation
of the women, which was in a fixed rhythm,<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c012'><sup>[523]</sup></a> while David’s
outburst is spontaneous and “free.” In cases of this kind, to
be sure, one must always reckon with the literary and artistic
element; but David’s <i>vocero</i> is close to the popular custom,
and of more value to the student than the lament of tragedy
old and new. Indeed, a kind of declamation over the dead
relative is often found in tragedy, with some resemblance to
the actual <i>vocero</i> both in matter and in style, but with an alien
touch of rhetoric; so Hieronimo, showing the corpse of his
son, has the repetition and play of words already noted among
the early Elizabethans, and at far remove from that “O my
son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom!” of the immediate
lament:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here lay my hope, and here my hope hath end;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here lay my heart, and here my heart was slain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here lay my treasure, here my treasure lost,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and the rest. Hamlet and Laertes at the grave of Ophelia
suggest further distortion, turning the lament into a kind of
flyting. It is the actual <i>vocero</i>, and the communal conditions
of it, from which one learns the course of poetry; and this
actual <i>vocero</i>, even in its Homeric form, has two elements, the
song of the relative and the answering wail of the throng.
With later conditions the single song comes to be professional,
as with Hebrews, Romans, and nearly all nations; or
else the women move with sympathetic gestures now round
the chief mourner, now round the corpse, singing and wailing
as they go. Like modern Syria, modern Greece keeps the
old custom; the myriologue has many features of the Homeric
rite, particularly the primitive trait of improvisation.
The song, says Fauriel,<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c012'><sup>[524]</sup></a> is never composed in advance, but is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>always improvised in the very moment that it is delivered, and
is always fitted to the person addressed. “It is always in
verse; the verses are always in the metre of other popular
songs; and they are always sung.” Each village—and the
communal trait is significant—has an air of its own for these
lamentations, and sings them to no other air. Hahn’s account<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c012'><sup>[525]</sup></a>
is worth quoting. When a man has died, the women
of his family make a fearful cry,<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c012'><sup>[526]</sup></a> which brings all the neighbouring
women to the house, shrieking, howling, and gesticulating
with the mourners. The actual relatives tear their hair,
dash their heads against the wall, <i>call upon the dead by name</i>,
and scream so loudly<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c012'><sup>[527]</sup></a> and continuously that for a time they
often lose their voices.<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c012'><sup>[528]</sup></a> So the women; the men are more
calm. The corpse is now washed and clad, whereupon the
women seat themselves about it, and the real lament begins.
“This is always rhythmic and generally consists of two
verses sung by one voice and repeated by the whole chorus
of women.” Now it is traditional, now improvised. As fast
as one woman is exhausted, another lifts her hand in signal
and begins a new verse. On the way to burial they sing in
the same fashion.</p>

<p class='c013'>This song over the dead, which is found throughout the
world, in Greenland, in Peru, in the Hebrides, among the
Hottentots,<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c012'><sup>[529]</sup></a> shows a course of development in which the detached
or literary lament is the latest stage. Here it may be
a great poem, pulsing with the grief of nations and close to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>the common heart, or a mere exercise made by rule; the gay
science of Provence, like the school poetry of Germany and
England, had minute directions for the making of a good
<i>planch</i>.<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c012'><sup>[530]</sup></a> “One may compose a song of lament in any melody,”
runs the Catalan rule, “save in the melody of a dance,”—strange
exception, when one comes to the dances which
so often went with the real <i>vocero</i>; and Master Vinesauf,<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c012'><sup>[531]</sup></a>
in his <i>Poetria</i>, called out Chaucer’s well-known gibe<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c012'><sup>[532]</sup></a> by the
recipe for a poem of grief. “When you wish to express
grief,” he advises, “say something like this;” and an appropriate
sentiment follows. That is the literary stage, the
detached lament; but behind the little artifice, as behind
the great art, lies the real <i>vocero</i> with elements that need
to be set in right perspective. We see the corpse, the wailing
relatives, the singing relatives, the professional singing
women, the whole clan in tumultuous grief, loud discordant
cries, a choral wail which is rhythmic and articulate, chanted
verses. Of all these the professional singing woman such as
Jeremiah invoked, the <i>praefica</i> of Rome, the keener at an
Irish funeral, is the nearest to literary lament, and connects
the communal with the artistic. Behind her, and taking her
place as one follows back the course of evolution, stands the
“free” or natural mourner, now and then a man,<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c012'><sup>[533]</sup></a> but usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>wife or mother or sister of the dead. Behind these,
again, stands the throng itself, the original mourners, clan
or horde of a time when the bonds of mere community were
stronger than any ties of kin, and when individual grief was
hardly if at all lifted from the communal level; and with
this stage one has come from elaborate verse, through choral
lament, to mere iteration of clamorous grief, rhythmical by
the consent of a throng and by the compulsion of dance, gesture,
and spasmodic utterance. In this communal refrain,
then, we reach the origin of all laments; here is surely one,
at least, of the “beginnings of poetry”; and in the <i>vocero</i> of
Corsica break forth even yet those cadenced interjections
which were heard throughout the Orient, spread over Greece
in the wailings for Adonis, and echo in the repeated denunciation
of Jeremiah: “They shall not lament for him, saying,
<i>Ah my brother!</i> or <i>Ah sister!</i>—They shall not lament for
him, saying, <i>Ah Lord!</i> or <i>Ah his glory!</i> He shall be buried
with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the
gates of Jerusalem.”<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c012'><sup>[534]</sup></a> But these earliest cadenced cries are
best approached by means of the second stage; and the song
of grief can still be heard in Corsica from wife or mother of
the dead, with all the force and naturalness of the <i>vocero</i> as
it is described by Homer and in the <i>Béowulf</i>. Elsewhere, of
course, and in Italy itself, one can find material of the sort.
D’Annunzio describes, in terms said to be rigorously correct,
a peasant mother’s improvised <i>vocero</i> at sight of her drowned
boy.<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c012'><sup>[535]</sup></a> After a few moments of silence, broken only by wild
outcries, she begins her spontaneous song in a short, panting
rhythm, rising and falling with the palpitations of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>heart; a characteristic noted also by writers on the Corsican
<i>vocero</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>We turn, then, first to this Corsican lament.<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c012'><sup>[536]</sup></a> <i>Voceri</i> they
call the songs, as one might say “vociferations,” a name
doubtless due to the <i>gridatu</i> or inarticulate wailings of the
throng, which precede the <i>vocero</i> proper; <i>lamenti</i> and <i>ballati</i>
are terms sometimes used instead, the second, of course,
referring to those dances which were once an inseparable
part of the rite, but are now seldom seen. “Make wide the
circle,” runs one lament, “and dance the <i>caracolu</i>; for this
sorrow is very sore.”<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c012'><sup>[537]</sup></a> As for the song itself, it is briefly
but adequately defined<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c012'><sup>[538]</sup></a> as an “improvised funeral song,”
sung by a near female relative of the dead man, in a strophe
of six verses with four measures to the verse, that verse
beloved everywhere of communal poetry; and since the
same occasion begets them all, all <i>voceri</i> have considerable
likeness one to another, with recurrence of word and phrase.
The speech of Corsica is itself rudely poetic; and these improvisations,
though full of traditional passages,—“sweeter
than honey”; “better than bread,”—are direct in their diction,
even to a point that seems at first sight to deny such a
fundamental communal trait as repetition. Iteration, however,
is there, insistently there, when one takes into account
not only the refrain, always breaking down into sobs and repeated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>moans, but the evident suppression of repetition in
the text. As to the refrain, the leader now bids all present
join her in this wailing cry, and now bids them cease in order
that she may be heard:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Di gratia, fate silenziu ...</div>
      <div class='line'>Finitele ste gride ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and now, again, she takes the refrain bodily into her own
song, beginning thus a new stanza. “<i>Di, di, dih!</i> Woe is
me! Make one great cry of sorrow, brothers and sisters
all,” sings a wife over her husband; and this inarticulate bit
of chorus, always sung, as Marcaggi says,<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c012'><sup>[539]</sup></a> at the end of each
stanza, by the women who surround the corpse, may be the
imitation—echo would better hit the truth—of the old sobbing
of the throng. As for the text, repetition is hardly to
be expected in print, and the editors have doubtless done as
Lyngbye did with Faroe ballads, though here and there
occurs a line<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c012'><sup>[540]</sup></a> like,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Chéta, chéta, chéta, o Sàgra,</div>
      <div class='line'>Chét’ é nun piegna piu tantu.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>They are keen to record the power of improvisation shown by
their countrywomen; what use to print pages of iteration?
A fine hint, however, can be found in Marcaggi’s forewords,
not only of the silly sooth but of the old time; he saw, he
says, “one day a poor woman run shrieking from her house,
her hair disordered, and coming to the public square, where
the corpse of her sister-in-law lay, sing in a mournful and
monotonous note, with grotesque leaps and bounds:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O commari Mari!</div>
      <div class='line'>O commari Mari!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>People said,” adds Marcaggi, “<i>that she was following the
custom of a former age</i>, and that she lacked proper reserve.”<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c012'><sup>[541]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>This is, indeed, the more primitive note; and the
iterated cry, mere appeal to the dead, like those <i>cris d’enterrement</i>
which Bladé heard at Gascon burials, was once sung by
the swaying and dancing throng of mourners. Psychologically
and physiologically this is quite in order; a kind of
communal hysterics, intensely rhythmical, as with a badly
frightened child, as with insanity, delirium, abnormal emotion
of any kind, has the cadent and recurrent note at its
utmost; and this woman, with her “lack of decorum,” like
that peasant on the beach by the drowned boy, is the modern
survivor and deputy of panic emotion, a belated case in the
pathology of epidemic grief. Between this mere iterated cry,
as was said above, and the later professional song of lament,<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c012'><sup>[542]</sup></a>
lie the bulk of Corsican <i>voceri</i>, sung by sister or mother of
the dead, and most characteristic when it is a violent death
which they deplore and when they will stir to vengeance a
group of male relatives standing sullenly by the corpse. For
while a <i>vocero</i> in the case of some peace-parted soul, such as
the village priest, is often a decorous and comforting office,<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c012'><sup>[543]</sup></a>
the passion of the thing is felt only over the bier of a man
murdered in feud. St. Victor, whom all the others quote on
this point, describes the scene. At first, in the chamber of
death, rises a great wail of lament, through which oaths of
vengeance flash like lightning; men draw their daggers, and
dash their guns upon the stone floor; women dip their handkerchiefs
in the blood still oozing from the wounds;<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c012'><sup>[544]</sup></a> sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>they are moved to a frenzy that vents itself in dancing
round the corpse amid loud cries, until silence is demanded
and the dead man’s mother, wife, sister, moves to the bier
and begins her <i>vocero</i>. There is no art in it; “the excuse
for its violence is in its explosive force, ... it sings through
the mouth of a wound.” It begins, however, in a plaintive
way, calls tenderly upon the dead, then tells the story of his
taking off; now the gently cadenced movements of the
singer grow more violent, and presently she breaks into a
storm of imprecations and into wild appeals for the vendetta.<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c012'><sup>[545]</sup></a>
One after another of these singers improvises such
a lament, and for every stanza a chorus of sobs and cries
and moans, often, one gathers, of articulate words, rises
from the throng. The passion, too, is real; readers who
come of northern blood must banish certain associations
of the cardboard castle, the cloak and sword, loud baritone
confidences, and stage moonlight. These <i>voceri</i> of
vengeance are not rated as rant by the law, which often and
vainly tries to put them down. Thus among the Basques,
a race, as George Borrow declared, not of poets but of singers,
laws were passed against the old fashion of the funeral;<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c012'><sup>[546]</sup></a> it
was forbidden “to make lamentations, to tear one’s hair, to
bruise the flesh, to wound one’s head, to chant death-songs.”
A Basque chorus of lament is described by Michel. “All
the women join in it with deep sighs and cries of grief,
addressed now to the dead and now to themselves; they
begin with high tones, then fall into a deep note, and pronounce
from time to time <i>ayené</i>, a Basque word which means
<i>Alas!</i>” It is quite clear that in these repeated words of
the chorus one finds the origin of the <i>vocero</i>, the “cry” of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>communal grief; and a study of such cries at the actual
burial, as they are still heard in Gascon funerals,<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c012'><sup>[547]</sup></a> shows
to what beginnings one must refer the more elaborate <i>voceri</i>
of the Corsicans. As early as 1340 a law was passed at
Tarbes against “cries and lamentations at the return from
a burial.” According to Bladé, the Gascon burial cries are
a kind of recitative, lacking rime and even what modern
ears demand in the way of rhythm, for they are now divorced
from the dance, and at best are timed to the steps of the
procession. They begin when a funeral procession starts
from the church to the cemetery, and are a series of “distinct
exclamations combined into irregular stanzas”; mostly they
begin “in a high note, falling slowly, to rise again at the
end.” The iteration of these cries is insistent; Bladé quotes
a long <i>cri</i> of the sort:<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c012'><sup>[548]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>Ah!</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah! Ah! Ah!</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah! Pauvre!</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah! Pauvre!</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah! Pauvre!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Mon Dieu!</div>
      <div class='line'>Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>Ah!</div>
      <div class='line'>Pauvre Père!</div>
      <div class='line'>Pauvre Père! Pauvre Père!</div>
      <div class='line'>Vous êtes mort, pauvre Père!</div>
      <div class='line'>Pauvre Père, vous êtes mort!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Vous êtes mort!</div>
      <div class='line'>Vous ne reviendrez jamais!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Jamais! Jamais!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Then the first stanza is repeated. The choral possibilities
of this cry are clear enough, and sung to the dance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>about a corpse, as was undoubtedly the primitive case, its
rhythm would have been exact and no “recitative.” A
further step is taken when individual and artistic touches
make themselves felt in a pretty little <i>cri</i> which is sung by
a mother<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c012'><sup>[549]</sup></a> over her child:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Pauvret!</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Ah!</div>
      <div class='line'>Tu seras bien seulet</div>
      <div class='line'>Au cimitière</div>
      <div class='line'>Cette nuit,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Et moi</div>
      <div class='line'>Je te pleurerai</div>
      <div class='line'>A la maison.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Mon Dieu!</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Ah!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Repetition is the original rhythm, the original poem; then
comes improvisation by the individual, begetting the increment
and founding a “text,” while variation plays upon the
repeated words. Such is the course of poetry, and in particular
of the <i>vocero</i>; repetition lies at the heart of it. Wetzstein,<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c012'><sup>[550]</sup></a>
describing the Syrian song of lament sung by the
women, lays stress upon the constant iteration in it, and
upon the chorus which consists mainly of a single word,—“woe!”
“alas!”—counterpart of the chorus in Corsican
and Basque <i>voceri</i>. Indeed, the <i>vocero</i> is not only inscribed
with woe, but was once nothing else; and fragments of this
or that “cry” of burial and of death found their way into
the mythology and the recorded poetry of Phœnicians, of
Egyptians, and of Greeks. Brugsch,<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c012'><sup>[551]</sup></a> in his study of the
songs about Adonis and Linos, makes it clear that Linos
was simply a personification of these Phœnician cries of
lament, <i>ai lenu</i>, the choral “alas!” or “woe to us!” The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>refrain or repeated cry of grief sung by mourners about their
dead finds thus both mythical and ritual projection and the
immortality insured by great artistic song. This <i>ai</i>, <i>ai</i>, seems
to be one of the oldest choral funeral cries, common, as
Brugsch puts it, “to the whole Orient as well as Egypt”;
and he follows it down to the exquisite elegy of Bion.
Linos, in the vintage songs, was made a personification of
this cry,<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c012'><sup>[552]</sup></a> became a Greek, was said to be buried in Argos,
and was worshipped on Helicon amid lamentations of matron
and maid gathered at the yearly festival. One remembers
Ezekiel’s wrath over the women who, in the gate of the
Lord’s house, were weeping for Tammuz. In the Egyptian
lament of Isis for Osiris, the opening words, “Come back,”
are repeated, as in the choral cry from which it sprang, and
are in accord not only with the <i>vocero</i> of Europe, but with
the refrain of a dirge in India:<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c012'><sup>[553]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The Egyptian <i>vocero</i>, the <i>ai en Ise</i>, is worth quoting in full:<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c012'><sup>[554]</sup></a>
“Come back, come back, God Panu, come back! For they
which were against thee are no more. Ah, fair helper, come
back to see me, thy sister, that love thee; and drawest thou
not nigh to me? Ah, fair youth, come back, come back! I
see thee not, my heart is sore for thee, my eyes seek thee.
I wander about for thee, to see thee in the form of Nai, to
see thee, to see thee, fair lord, in the form of Nai, to see
thee, the fair one,—to see thee, to see thee, God Panu, the
fair one! Come to thy darling, blessed Ounophris, come to
thy sister, come to thy wife, come to thy wife, God Urtuhet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>come to thy spouse! I am thy sister, I am thy mother, and
thou comest not to me; the face of gods and of men is turned
to thee, while they weep thee, seeing me that weep for thy
sake, that weep and cry to heaven that thou hear my prayer,—for
I am thy sister that loved thee on earth. Never lovedst
thou another than me, thy sister! Never lovedst thou another
than me, thy sister!” Like the companion lament of Nephthys,
this is distinctly a <i>vocero</i> of the sister over the brother;
and the repeated <i>mââ-ne-hra</i>, “come home,” the refrain of
the piece, gave rise to the name Maneros, fabled to be a
prince of Egypt, a fact which reminded Herodotus of the
similar song of Linos in Greece. In his chapter on the
Lityerses song, Mannhardt<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c012'><sup>[555]</sup></a> notes that this name, too, with
that of Bormos, both supposed to be sons of a king, like
Maneros, Linos, Mannerius, was developed out of an old
refrain. The Greeks, singing a lay which corresponded to
the Maneros, went with choral cries and music to seek the
vanished Bormos. So, too, with Hylas; a Bithynian festival
is on record, where sacrifice is made at the scene of his capture
by the nymphs; and the festal throng thereupon wander
over the hills and about the Hylas Lake, crying incessantly
upon his name. It is needless to follow all these myths and
the ritual connected with them; nor can we turn aside and
study the memorial festivals of the dead, like that old Germanic
feast in November, now surviving in All Souls’ Day, where
masses said for the repose of Christian dead, and flowers laid
upon their tombs, took the place of older sacrifice, dance, and
song.<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c012'><sup>[556]</sup></a> What one sees beyond question is the origin of funeral
songs in the communal chorus, and what one infers with great
probability is that death, and the resulting expression of communal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>grief in choral song and dance, had much more to do
with earliest forms of poetry than even the erotic impulse.
Sociology now declares that primitive feeling for children,
relatives, clan, was far keener in its emotional expression
than the sense of sexual desire.<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c012'><sup>[557]</sup></a> The importance of the
love-lyric, now overwhelming, and mainly an individual outburst,
yields in primitive life to the importance of the choral
<i>vocero</i> over a dead clansman; so that, using the terms in a
modern way, one must reverse that saying of the preacher:
it was death that was stronger than love. Coming back to
modern survivals, one finds this <i>vocero</i> common, both in its
individual and in its choral form, among the Celts. Leaving
the Ossianic lament alone in its gloom, one may take the
honest and homely prose of Pennant,<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c012'><sup>[558]</sup></a> who made a tour
through Scotland in the year 1769, and saw a lyke-wake<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c012'><sup>[559]</sup></a>—he
calls it a “late-wake”—in the Highlands. “The evening
after the death of any person, the relatives and friends
of the deceased meet at the house, attended by bagpipe and
fiddle; the nearest of kin, be it wife, son, or daughter, opens
a melancholy ball, dancing and greeting, <i>i.e.</i> crying violently,
at the same time; and this continues till daylight, but with
such gambols and frolics among the younger part of the
company that the loss which occasioned them is often more
than supplied by the consequences of that night.” This is
eighteenth-century humour, and an eighteenth-century reason
to explain the hilarity is quoted from Olaus Magnus. Unfortunately
Pennant did not hear what he calls the “Coranich”;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>but he learned that such a song is generally in praise of the
dead, a recital of his deeds or the deeds of his forbears. Questions,
too, were addressed to the corpse, why, for example,
he chose to die—a common trait of the <i>vocero</i>, already put
to use by Chaucerian humour,<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c012'><sup>[560]</sup></a> and noted by old Camden;
Pennant remarks that the mother of Euryalus makes the
same query.<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c012'><sup>[561]</sup></a> But Pennant had heard such songs in the
south of Ireland; and this feature of an Irish wake is still
accessible to the curious. On its native soil it has been often
studied and described.<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c012'><sup>[562]</sup></a> When the corpse has been laid out,
“the women of the household range themselves at either
side, and the keen (<i>caoine</i>) at once commences. They rise
with one accord, and moving their bodies with a slow motion
to and fro, their arms apart, they ... keep up a heart-rending
cry. This cry is interrupted for a while to give the <i>ban
caointhe</i>, the leading keener, an opportunity of commencing.
At the close of every stanza of the dirge the cry is repeated.”
The authors give the air to which keens are chanted.
“The keen usually consists in an address to the corpse, asking
him, ‘Why did he die?’—or a description of his person,
qualifications, riches; it is altogether extemporaneous.”
A note attributes the ease of improvisation to the fact that
assonance, “vocal rime,” is enough to satisfy the needs of
Irish verse. The keener is often a professional and paid;
sometimes a volunteer and a member of the family. “Any
one present, however, who has the gift, may put in his or
her verse; and this sometimes occurs.... Besides <i>caoines</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>extempore compositions over the dead, <i>thirrios</i>, or written
elegies, deserve mention. They are composed almost exclusively
by men, as the <i>caoines</i> are by women.” One thinks
of Marcaggi’s poetical bandits and their written effusions as
compared with the improvised songs of the <i>voceratrice</i> over
her dead. It is odd to see how the zeal of certain antiquarians
would reverse the law of nature, and make this improvised
keen a degenerate form of older and carefully composed
elegies of Irish “bards.” O’Conor thought the old keen to
be “debased by extemporaneous composition”;<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c012'><sup>[563]</sup></a> and a Mr.
Blanford<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c012'><sup>[564]</sup></a> describes the degradation in detail. The keen, he
says, was once an antiphonal affair prepared beforehand, and
sung by bards with the aid of a chorus,—elaborate in every
way. On the decline of these bards, “the Caoinan fell into
the hands of women, and became an extemporaneous performance.”
Like the degeneration theory of ballads, this
account of the keen goes to pieces under the test of comparative
and historical studies. Spenser, to be sure, speaks
of these bards, and not without respect;<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c012'><sup>[565]</sup></a> but it is clear that
the ancestral line of the keen among Irishmen runs back to
“the lamentations at theyr burialls, with dispayrefull outcryes
and immoderate wailings,”<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c012'><sup>[566]</sup></a> which he mentions in his
argument to prove that the Irish are descended from the
Scythians. Would that Spenser had not cut short his tale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“of theyr old maner of marrying, of burying, of dauncyng, of
singing, of feasting, of cursing, <i>though Christians have wiped
out the most part of them</i>,”—best reason for telling in detail
of all the Christians had left!</p>

<p class='c013'>Wailings, cries now articulate and now inarticulate, but
wrought by repetition, by the cadence of rocking bodies, or
of measured steps, by the spasmodic utterance of extreme
emotion, into a choral consent which is not harmony, perhaps,
to modern ears, but which has a rhythm of its own,—these
are the raw material of the poetry of grief. Like the
“cries” at a Gascon burial, like the Irish keen, is the <i>rauda</i>
of Russian Lithuania, which Bartsch<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c012'><sup>[567]</sup></a> significantly calls “a
preliminary stage of actual folksong.” This <i>rauda</i> or <i>daina</i>
is sung by women; it lacks what one calls melody and verse;
and it is sung mostly on the way to the burial or at the grave.
Prætorius, at the end of the seventeenth century, describes
the Lithuanian <i>vocero</i> as a mingled song and sob, with the
usual questions to the corpse, so familiar in the Irish keen—why
did the man die, had he not enough to eat and drink, had
he not clothes and shoes?<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c012'><sup>[568]</sup></a> Brand, who made his tour in
1673, tells the same story; relatives and friends, however,
are here seated round the corpse, shrieking and howling,
to be sure, but in words of a more lyric tone: “Why hast thou
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>left us? Whither art thou gone? I shall go to thee, but
thou wilt not come to me.”<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c012'><sup>[569]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Enough has been said to show the origins of the <i>vocero</i> in
Europe. Among the Tartar folk of Siberia, songs of lament,
although nearly always improvised, have more the character
of an elegy, and are sung by the relatives of the dead during
a full year after the funeral.<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c012'><sup>[570]</sup></a> If the husband dies, it is his
wife who makes the song; if son or daughter dies, it is the
mother; while a dead mother is sung by her daughter or a
near female relative. Men sing these songs only when a
rich or powerful person dies, and then only at the funeral:<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c012'><sup>[571]</sup></a>
one thinks of David over Jonathan and Saul, and of that old
king in the <i>Béowulf</i>. Among the Eskimo,<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c012'><sup>[572]</sup></a> however, occurs
a <i>vocero</i> precisely like the type which has been found common
to the primitive customs of Europe,—a song by the near
relative, with chorus of moans, sobs, and cries from the
women who stand about. Coming to the distinctly savage
state, one finds material enough to fill a book, all going to
prove that a choral cry and not an individual composition must
be taken as starting-point of the <i>vocero</i>. “Of the Tasmanians,
Mr. Davis relates<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c012'><sup>[573]</sup></a> that ‘during the whole of the first night<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c012'><sup>[574]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>after the death of one of their tribe they will sit round
the body, using rapidly a low, continuous recitative, to prevent
the evil spirit from taking it away.’” Naturally
the artist comes early upon the scene; dirges, eulogies,
elegies of every sort, are built on this choral foundation;
and that communal magic, if it was anything more than a
Tasmanian <i>vocero</i>, is soon replaced by the magic of the
individual shaman. To put him in the van of funeral lament,
however, to say that he preceded communal and choral
wailings for the dead, is ignoring the facts of primitive life
and the instincts of human nature. Comparetti makes the
magic songs of the Finns precede their heroic and legendary
verse, and this may well be true; but the communal lament
is older than both, for, as was seen in the case of the Botocudos,
primitive folk have no legend, no history, and as for
the magic, while the sayings of a shaman would get the
earliest record, they demand a communal background. For
it is the unavoidable condition of all recorded literature that
what is of the moment and of the mass dies with its occasion;
while only individual skill, the hand of a single performer, is
moved to keep the record of his doing on purpose to a life
beyond life. Even the humblest shaman, too, learns his art
and his rude ritual from an older artist in magic,<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c012'><sup>[575]</sup></a> and so his
making becomes a tradition and his verses flit from mouth to
mouth. But the history of religion has taught us to look
elsewhere than to the temple and the priest and the Deus
Optimus Maximus of civilized worship, if we would find the
beginnings of cult and the earliest divinity. As we go back
to a horde of homogeneous men, so we go back to a horde of
homogeneous spirits; as one spirit rises above the rest, so
the shaman is deputed, with his superior powers,<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c012'><sup>[576]</sup></a> to cope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>with the superior god. It was the “we” of the horde, in
the new sense of coherence and social being, which started
that communal thinking and made that communal belief in
the “they” of a surrounding and potent host of spirits; and
it is not unreasonable to suppose that communal appeal,
sheer cries and leaps in some wild consent of rhythm, must
have begun those magic rites which are perhaps to be surmised
in no very advanced stage in the songs of Mr. Davis’s
Tasmanians. Actual incantations that come down to us are
full of repetition, and frequently have a chorus or refrain;<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c012'><sup>[577]</sup></a>
elements that point back to a communal source. Among
American Indians the necromantic songs abound in a chorus
which is nearly all repetition, like<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c012'><sup>[578]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c013'>But it is the <i>vocero</i> which we are now to study among savage
tribes. A case or so from Africa and Asia will do for
that side of the world—evidence is more than abundant—and
then America may tell its tale at a time when borrowing
is out of the question. M. Adanson, a correspondent of the
Royal Academy of Sciences, travelled in Senegal about 1750;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>his account<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c012'><sup>[579]</sup></a> of <i>vocero</i> and dance is fairly representative of
the case. One night in a village he was awakened by a “horrid
shrieking,” and found that a young woman had just died.
What follows is interesting for comparison with the custom
in modern Greece. “The first shriek was made,” says M.
Adanson, “according to custom, by one of the female relations
of the deceased before her door. At this signal, all
the women in the village came out and set up a most terrible
howl, so that one would have thought they were all related
to the deceased;” the traveller forgets that in certain levels
of culture the clan, even the horde, is above kin. The noise
lasted till break of day; relatives then went into the dead
woman’s cottage, took her hand, and asked her questions,—the
common trait of the <i>vocero</i> everywhere. When she was
buried, the lamentations ceased; but for three nights the
young people danced a memorial dance. At this the performers
sang a song, “the burden of which was repeated by
all the spectators.” Then follows the description of certain
erotic features of the dance, and the usual testimony to that
exactness of time observed in song and movement and gesture.
The <i>vocero</i> itself is mainly a lament; Mungo Park
speaks of “the loud and dismal howlings,” another of “leaping
and dancing”; while in Loango relatives “weep, sing,
and dance” about the corpse.<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c012'><sup>[580]</sup></a> In Korea, after a night of
merriment the body is carried to its tomb; “the bearers sing
and keep time as they go, whilst the kindred and friends ...
make the air ring with their cries.”<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c012'><sup>[581]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Interesting are the accounts of American Indians in the
days of discovery. Jean de Lery, a Frenchman who went to
Brazil with the Protestant emigrants in the sixteenth century,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>and wrote an account of his journey,<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c012'><sup>[582]</sup></a> was struck by the likeness
between the funeral laments made by savages, and the
<i>voceri</i> of the women of Béarn singing over their dead husbands.
He quotes one, a good document. “‘La mi amou, La
mi amou: Cara rident, œil de splendou: Cama lengé, bet
dansadou: Lo mé balen, Lo m’esburbat: Matî depes: fort
tard au lheit.’ That is to say, ‘my love, my love, laughing
face, fine eye, light limb, brave dancer, valiant mien, lovely
mien, early up and late to bed.’” So too the Gascon women:
“‘Yere, yere, o le bet renegadou, o le bet iougadou qu ‘here’:
that is to say, ‘O the brave Protestant, O the brave player
that he was!’ And so do our poor American women, who,
besides a refrain for each stanza,<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c012'><sup>[583]</sup></a> always throw in a ‘He is
dead, he is dead, for whom we now are mourning,’ whereupon
the men respond and say: ‘Alas, it is true; we shall never
see him more until we are behind the mountains, where, as
our Caribs tell us, we shall dance with him’—and other
things of the sort, which they add in their response.” Lescarbot,<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c012'><sup>[584]</sup></a>
quoting Lery about the Brazilians, remarks the
agreement in songs of lament between them and the Canadians
“fifteen hundred leagues away.” Such a song ran—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hé hé hé hé hé hé hé hé hé hé,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>a monotonous performance on paper, with the notes <i>fa</i> <i>fa</i> <i>sol</i>
<i>fa</i> <i>fa</i> <i>sol</i> <i>sol</i> <i>sol</i> <i>sol</i> <i>sol</i>, not too elaborate music; but bodily
graces made up for this, since they then “shrieked and cried
in fearful wise the space of a quarter-hour, and the women
leaped into the air with such violence as to foam at the
mouth.” Then once more the tuneful mood began, and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>sang, “Heu heüraüre heüra heüraüre heüra heüra onech.”
In this song they are mourning for their dead parents. As with
Lery and Lescarbot, so the spirit of comparison is astir in
Lafitau,<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c012'><sup>[585]</sup></a> who, however, has less to tell of folklore at home,
and a great deal to say of the ancients, as may be gathered
from the title of his book; the laments for the dead he calls
<i>nénies</i>, and speaks of the “matron” who plays the part of
<i>praefica</i>. He tells, however, a plain story of the savage
customs. When a corpse has been dressed and laid in state,
tears and lamentations, restrained up to that time, begin to
break forth, but in order and cadence. The “matron” leads
the other women, who “follow in the same measure, <i>but use
different words, according to the relation which they bear to the
deceased</i>,”—second stage of the <i>vocero</i>, with a survival of
the chorus, however, far more pronounced than in Corsica.
Men, too, mourn their dead, but in a nobler way, singing the
death-song and dancing the hereditary dance;<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c012'><sup>[586]</sup></a> but these
<i>voceri</i> of the women are of great interest. Grosse<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c012'><sup>[587]</sup></a> quotes
from Grey the Australian <i>vocero</i> for a young man, where
“the young women sing—‘My young brother,’—the old
women sing—‘My young son,’—and all in chorus sing—‘Never
shall I see thee again, Never shall I see thee
again.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>In Schoolcraft’s<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c012'><sup>[588]</sup></a> time things had undergone no great
change; for “every person aggrieved makes his own complaint,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>and it is pitiful to see a married person commence
wailing and singing <i>kitchina takah</i>, then wailing again <i>kitchina</i>,—‘men’s
friend.’ These are all the words,”—a significant
fact. “The same way in other deaths the deceased
is bewailed.” Here is the single <i>vocero</i>; but it is a faint
affair in comparison with the volume and sound of the
funeral chorus. Schoolcraft’s evidence all runs this way.
“Choruses,” says Mr. Fletcher,<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c012'><sup>[589]</sup></a> “are about all the Indians
sing.” Carver,<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c012'><sup>[590]</sup></a> to be sure, like the other travellers, tells of a
mother who seemed to improvise a song of lament over her
dead child at the time when it was laid among the branches;
but he is emphatic about the chorus, and calls it “a not
unpleasing but savage harmony.” A recent writer,<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c012'><sup>[591]</sup></a> noting
the monotonous choral songs at funerals, thinks “these
chants may no doubt occasionally have been simply wailing
or mourning ejaculation.” As one comes to lower levels of
culture, among the Patagonians, for example, and the interior
tribes of Africa, mere choral iteration of monotonous sounds
and beating the ground with the feet—perhaps not so much
“to keep off the evil one”<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c012'><sup>[592]</sup></a> as to find the communal consent—are
the prevailing characteristics of the <i>vocero</i>. The funeral
dance of the Latuka, which Baker saw,<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c012'><sup>[593]</sup></a> really comes to this;
while the feathers, the bells, the horns, are easily recognized
as lendings of an incipient culture, and teach the plain lesson
that the state of the African savage is not to be transferred
outright to primitive man. Indeed, it is quite evident that
such perfect consent of communal voice and step as was
shown by the Botocudos may be confused and broken in
what one must call higher stages of culture,—for example,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>that dance of the Latuka. In Nubia Miss Edwards<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c012'><sup>[594]</sup></a> saw a
ceremony, mainly dance, at the grave of a member of the
tribe, which seemed to her artificial in the extreme. “The
lamentation itself is a definite musical phrase executed by
women who, beginning on a high note, proceed down the
scale in third-tones to the lower octave or even the twelfth.
It is taught, like the <i>zaghareet</i>, or cry of joy, by mothers to
their young daughters in their earliest years.” It is only
when the historian looks at all this evidence of savage dance
and cry, of feminine song and choral response, of refrain
passing into rite and myth, of detached and artistic lament,
and when he applies to it the evolutionary test, the comparative
and historical test, that it lies in true perspective and
allows him to draw some definite conclusion about one at least
of the beginnings of poetry. The <i>vocero</i> began as communal
wailing, horde or clan or house mourning the brother and
inmate in rhythmic cries to the cadence of the dance; with
new domestic ties of blood, in which of course the mother
and sister are supreme,<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c012'><sup>[595]</sup></a> these two stand out as singers of the
solitary <i>vocero</i> to which the crowd makes answer in refrain.
The inevitable sundering of individual and chorus now makes
headway, the former passing into literature, the latter, dropping
its concomitant dance and surviving as refrain, dies
slowly out in all save a few isolated communities, and in all
recorded verse except here and there a chanted dirge. But
in each of these diverging fortunes, as in the earliest, so in
the last estate of the <i>vocero</i>, in elegy, threnody, ode, one
common trait abides; and everywhere it echoes the insistent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>voice of repetition.<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c012'><sup>[596]</sup></a> As an example of this repetition, as well
as of the <i>vocero</i> in its earlier stage, we may conclude with an
iterated verse sung by a negro woman, once a slave, who
still lived with her master’s family in the South.<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c012'><sup>[597]</sup></a> She had
just buried her husband, but went about her tasks as usual
and waited upon the children of the house. Suddenly, however,
in their presence, and to their great fright, she burst
out with these words,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O dem ropes dat let him down!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and continued to sing them without ceasing, in a strange
crooning way, the better part of an hour, and at intervals
during some days. It were to consider too curiously, perhaps,
if one should compare this crude case of “vision” with
certain forms of poetry that bear a similar relation to the
original song of grief.</p>

<p class='c013'>So much for the <i>vocero</i>. It has led us from the ballads
back to that ethnological evidence making so strongly, in
diction as in rhythm, for the primitive note of iteration,
for the fundamental element which marks the communal
origin of poetry, precisely as variation has marked its individual
and artistic course. Repetition of sounds, when
joined with act of labour, with march or dance, with strong
emotion of a festal or communal kind, made possible the
perception of consent, or, to speak with Professor Baldwin
Brown, of order. It begets this sense of order in other
arts; repetition of a certain kind of line on a jar made a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>rhythm of decoration, just as a series of similar groups of
words, of steps, made poetry and dance. How important
repetition must have been in early poetry, and in any unrecorded
verse, is clear when one reflects that the invention
of writing turned poetry from an art wholly of time and
succession to an art half plastic; we see the line, the stanza,
nowadays, and repetition is an impertinence in poetry, because
hearing has become a secondary and imagined process.
The æsthetic value of repetition in primitive verse
gets a new aspect when one considers</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wie das Wort so wichtig dort war,</div>
      <div class='line'>Weil es ein gesprochen Wort war;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>although that other protest is right enough for one who has
only modern poetry in view:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>Ich kann das Wort so hoch unmöglich schätzen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>For repetition as the main element in savage poetry it is
useless to spread out evidence; no one denies the fact, and
ethnology is full of it. From surviving incremental repetition,
as in the <i>Kalevala</i> and in the ballads, one passes back,
with the increment steadily diminishing, to outright and unrelieved
iteration. The Africans have songs, some of them
known as “national,” which consist of a single word, arranged
in rude rhythmic groups, repeated for hours; and they get
as much satisfaction from it as presumably those Ephesians
got out of their own vehement and repeated cry. Lery
and Lescarbot heard these songs of an iterated word.
Lafitau<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c012'><sup>[598]</sup></a> says that Father Marquette saw Indians dance the
calumet dance, and was surprised “that the slave in singing
said nothing but the single word <i>Alleluia</i>,”—of course an
accidental coincidence of sounds,—“pronouncing the <i>u</i> after
the Italian fashion, and dividing the word into two parts.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>The iterated word in primitive song has its meaning somewhere,
but often shades back into an inarticulate sound, and
shades forward into a traditional and unintelligible cry, mere
relief of emotion. Perhaps words of this sort went with the
“detestable air” which Mary Shelley heard at the <i>festas</i> near
her house in Italy.<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c012'><sup>[599]</sup></a> The countryfolk, “like wild savages,
...  in different bands, the sexes always separate, pass the
whole night in dancing on the sands close to our door, running
into the sea, then back again, all the time yelling one
detestable air at the top of their voices,—the most detestable
air in the world.” The favourite song of the Botocudos,
their lyric mainstay, was just <i>Kălăuīā ahā́</i>, repeated
indefinitely. The chorus of Indian war-songs, in North
America, “consists for the most part of traditionary monosyllables
which appear to admit often of transposition, and
the utterance of which, at least, is so managed as to permit
the words to be sung in strains to suit the music and
dance.”<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c012'><sup>[600]</sup></a> Dr. Brinton, in a summary of the characteristics
of American aboriginal poetry,<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c012'><sup>[601]</sup></a>—which was always sung,—noting
that repetition is the groundwork, says that this element
of iteration has two forms: a verse is sung repeatedly,
which of course makes some statement, or there is a repeated
refrain; but this refrain is wholly interjectional and
meaningless. The Fuegians often sing not so much as a
word, but only a syllable repeated forever. Progress is in
the text, and by the individual; communal reminiscence is
in the refrain: it is clear, then, that the refrain is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>original “poem,” and to the refrain one must look for an
idea of beginnings. A. W. Schlegel<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c012'><sup>[602]</sup></a> conjectured that the
earliest forms of lyric poetry were due to an “effort of the
human heart to express a feeling or mood and to give it
permanence by tone and rhythm,” this effort resulting at first
“in simple words and interjections often repeated.” These
are kept in the chorus or refrain; incremental repetition, as
was shown above, works its way in the text. The chorus,
to be sure, rises soon to the dignity of a coherent sentence;
but its communal and retrograde force still is strong, and
it insists on naked repetition, while individual singers
cherish the increment. Miss Kingsley<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c012'><sup>[603]</sup></a> heard the Bubis
sing in chorus over and over for hours this verse and
nothing more,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The shark bites the Bubi’s hand.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A more advanced stage is seen in the cautious but distinct
incremental repetition of a singer among the North American
Indians; we quote from Schoolcraft:<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c012'><sup>[604]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>That is, “I will walk into somebody’s home.” The following
words proceed very cautiously. “The composer appears
to commence with delicacy ... singing that he would walk
into some indefinite home. The next line implies that he
will walk into his or her home. In the third line ... he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>will walk into her home during some night. He then informs
her that he will walk into her dwelling during the
winter. In the fifth line”—it is really a stanza, with that
eternal chorus—“he becomes decisive and bold, and says
he will walk into her lodge this night.” So, too, the warrior
sings:<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c012'><sup>[606]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

      <div class='line'>The Americans I will kill!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But the repeated air of that “cereal chorus,”<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c012'><sup>[607]</sup></a> when a girl
gets a crooked ear at the husking, has the stricter note:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wagemin, wagemin,</div>

      <div class='line'>Wagemin, wagemin,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Paimosaid.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The work of developing poetry from a rhythmic chaos of
wild and repeated cries up to a chorus of this kind was a
communal achievement; art is responsible for increment and
variation. Communal consent in rhythm caused the repetition
of more or less articulate sounds, and so developed that
most important element in primitive speech now known as
emphasis. Repetition, which is modern emphasis in sections,
marks the event or sensation which it records as something
out of the common, holds it in the ear and before the mind
as something to note and to keep noting, and so makes for
memory, not idly called the mother of the muses, while it
heightens the actual emotional state. Just as certain early
efforts of plastic art expressed great wisdom by several
heads, great strength by a number of hands, great fecundity
by many breasts, so early man by the iteration of a word gave
it poetic force; a better art seeks perfection of the single feature,
and fitness of the single word. It has been shown
already how poetry made a gain when repetition of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>certain number of sounds gave ease to the instinct for harmony,
and a yet greater gain when the regular recurrence of
a louder sound or a longer sound satisfied the craving for finer
distinctions;<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c012'><sup>[608]</sup></a> it has been shown how the mere zeal of repetition
was crossed by increment and variation, until the oldest
element of poetry was made superfluous in the plainer form
and was almost utterly driven out of diction, with no refuge
but rhythm and certain forms of lyric sacred and profane. In
this plain and outright form of repeated words, however, it
lingered long in ballads, in festal rites, and of course among
the savages; it is in the refrain, therefore, that one can still
find some hints of the actual beginnings of poetry. The
refrain has been touched incidentally in the treatment of
repetition; it is now to be considered for itself.<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c012'><sup>[609]</sup></a> Important
as it is in ballads, the refrain has even weightier meanings
when studied in what may be called the occasional poetry
of the people.</p>

<p class='c013'>The refrain, which in its communal function survives as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>repetition pure and simple practised by the throng, and in
its artistic function has come to be the means of marking off
a strophe or stanza, is really the discredited and impoverished
heir of that choral song which by general consent
stands at the beginning of all poetry. This choral song,
under the influence of art and the reflecting, remembering,
individual mind, was developed into such forms of epic,
drama, lyric, as meet us, more or less divested of communal
traits and conditions, on the threshold of every national
literature. Greek tragedy is a well-known case in point.
The refrain, however, is not a development but a survival,<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c012'><sup>[610]</sup></a>
so far, at least, as communal conditions are involved; and
even in ballads what is called the refrain or the burden is a
slowly yielding communal element fighting hopelessly against
invading elements of art. In other words, as the ballad
recedes into primitive conditions, the refrain grows more and
more insistent, so that for the earliest form of the ballad, now
nowhere to be found, but easy to reconstruct by the help of
an evident evolutionary curve, one must assume not the
refrain as such, but rather choral song outright. Different
altogether from this communal survival is the artistic use of
the refrain. The extreme of art and often of artifice is
reached in those forms of verse which were developed out of
the older minstrelsy of France, and are known as <i>ballade</i>,
<i>rondel</i>, <i>triolet</i>, <i>chant royal</i>, with a refrain as their distinguishing
feature; it is conceded, however, that in the first instance
this refrain was everywhere taken from popular song.<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c012'><sup>[611]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Learned poetry of the Middle Ages,<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c012'><sup>[612]</sup></a> to be sure, imitated not
the vernacular refrain, but the refrain of classical verse; this,
however, in its turn had been taken from the poetry of the
people, and, whether one considers the <i>Hymen, O Hymenaee</i>
of Catullus,<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c012'><sup>[613]</sup></a> or the later <i>Cras amet qui nunqnam amavit</i>,
which trips so featly through the <i>Pervigilium Veneris</i><a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c012'><sup>[614]</sup></a> and
keeps such true step with the popular rhythm of its stanzas,
is at no great remove from communal song.</p>

<p class='c013'>But refrains of artistic poetry are of subordinate interest for
our study of primitive verse; and it is clear that all investigations
which neglect the older and more popular phases, which
neglect the primitive choral song and the primitive communal
conditions, can lead to no valid conclusions about the refrain.
It is something, of course, when Bujeaud explains this or
that refrain of a modern song as imitated from sounds of
some musical instrument, or taken from the <i>argot</i> of the
streets;<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c012'><sup>[615]</sup></a> but when Rosières<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c012'><sup>[616]</sup></a> undertakes to tell the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>story of the refrain, and settle its origins beyond doubt, saying
now that it “springs from the periodic return of full sounds,”
now that it is a <i>tra-la-la</i> to take the place of musical instruments,
now that it is “a little poem stuck in all the fissures of
a big poem,” and now, with a passing recognition of communal
conditions, but with sufficient vagueness, that it voices popular
song, then, indeed, one feels the vanity of dogmatizing to
the full.<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c012'><sup>[617]</sup></a> The need of comparative, historical, and genetic
study is also evident in a similar essay on the refrain in
Middle High German. Freericks<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c012'><sup>[618]</sup></a> regards the original
refrain not as repetition of the words of a singer but as an
expression of sentiment which they evoke, coming back in
cries of sorrow or of joy. “When utterances of this sort
continually interrupt the song, there is the refrain in its simplest
form.” So too Minor,<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c012'><sup>[619]</sup></a> in his book on German metres,
calls the refrain “the original cry of the throng in answer to
the song of the singer.” Against all this, Dr. R. M. Meyer,
in two essays,<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c012'><sup>[620]</sup></a> makes emphatic and successful protest. With
an eye on conditions and not on theory, Meyer shows the
refrain to belong to the oldest poetry of man,—inarticulate
cries at first, in rhythmic sequence, to express fear, wonder,
grief, affection. The refrain, for example, is the original
part of a threnody, as we have seen very plainly in our study
of the <i>vocero</i>; in short, so far from being an aftergrowth of
communal song, this refrain is declared by Dr. Meyer to be
the very root of the matter. With more attention to choral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>song in the horde or clan, Posnett has come closer to the
facts than Meyer, who failed to appreciate all the communal
conditions of such early verse; for while Meyer referred to
inarticulate cries as a beginning of the refrain, it is evident
that these immediately formed the chorus, and that the
refrain is rather survival and deputy of this old chorus than
the chorus outright. The refrain, in other words, allows one
to feel one’s way back to the choral song of the horde,<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c012'><sup>[621]</sup></a> but is
not to be transferred to those primitive times even in its
unintelligible and inarticulate forms. To make this clear, we
must study the refrain in its various communal survivals.</p>

<p class='c013'>Records of early literature and early religion show the
refrain in its original guise as a part of the choral song, and
it echoes audibly the steps of the dance. Nowhere is this
echo more insistent than in that hymn of the Arval brothers,
sung, of course, with a dance that was confined to the priests,
and already come a long way from the shouting and leaping
throng of primitive time; nevertheless, as a hymn used
in processions about the fields, it is to be connected with the
survivals of similar rites and the songs still heard from European
peasants at the harvest-home. In the inscription which
preserves it, each verse, except the last, is given thrice.<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c012'><sup>[622]</sup></a> A

<p class='c013'>Refrain and iteration are here in thrall to religious ceremony,
and the priest has laid hands upon the rough material
of the throng; but the throng is present, takes part,—even
if, in later time, by deputies,—and invention is at a minimum,
appearing only in its regulative, and not in its originating
force. It is easy to see how question and answer, strophe
and antistrophe, are simply a development and division out
of the crowd with one voice, as in the Greek chorus. So,
too, in an Assyrian hymn:<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c012'><sup>[625]</sup></a>—</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The Hebrew psalms<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c012'><sup>[626]</sup></a> show very clearly a more or less artistic
use of the refrain sung under congregational and therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>to some extent communal conditions.<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c012'><sup>[627]</sup></a> These communal
conditions can be guessed in their older and simpler form
from such an account as is given of David and his dancing
before the ark, when he “and all the house of Israel brought
up the ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of
the trumpet”;<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c012'><sup>[628]</sup></a> the personal song detached itself from the
rhythmic shouts of the dancing or marching multitude precisely
as the song of the wife and sister over their dead came
out clearer and clearer from the wailings of the clan. So, if
D. H. Müller be right, following in the path marked by
Lowth, the form of Hebrew prophecy was at first choral,
then was divided into strophe and antistrophe, yielding in
time to an impassioned solo of the prophet himself. In any
case, this single prophet, in historical perspective, lapses into
the throng, into those “prophetic hordes” which Budde compares
with modern Dervishes, “raving bands” now forgotten
or dimly seen in the background of a stage where noble individuals
like Amos, still in close touch with the people, play
the chief part, and hold the conspicuous place.<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c012'><sup>[629]</sup></a> As Amos
and his brother prophets yield to the later guild whose prophecies
were written, so one goes behind Amos to the “bands,”
to communal prophecy, to the repeated shouts and choral
exhortation, and so to the festal horde of all early religious
rites. The backward course would be from a prophecy written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>to be read, to the chanted blessing or imprecation of the
seer; thence to a singing and shouting band under the leadership
of one man, with constant refrain; and at last to the
shouting and dancing of purely communal excitement, the
real chorus. Moses and the children of Israel “sang a song
unto the Lord, saying, I<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c012'><sup>[630]</sup></a> will sing unto the Lord.... And
Miriam the prophetess ... took a timbrel in her hand, and
all the women went out after her with timbrels and with
dances. And Miriam <i>answered</i> them, Sing ye to the Lord.”
Here is certainly no premeditated verse; and it must
be borne in mind that refrains, except where they have a
sacred tradition behind them and are kept up by the priests,
as in the Arval “minutes,” easily drop from the record. Oral
tradition, on the other hand, is fain to hold fast to all these
vain repetitions; they are the salt of the thing. Now and
then an unmistakable refrain is preserved. “And it came to
pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter
of the Philistines, that the women came out of all the cities
of Israel, <i>singing and dancing</i>, to meet King Saul, with timbrels,
with joy, and with instruments of music. <i>And the
women sang one to another in their play</i>, and said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>That women in all nations and at certain stages of culture
make songs of triumph like this, as they dance and sing,
is known to the most careless reader; one or two chorals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>strangely similar to these songs of the Hebrew women,
may be noted from mediæval Europe. Now it is the singing
of Gothic songs of welcome by those maidens who come
from their village, as the women of Israel from their cities,
to meet and greet Attila,<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c012'><sup>[632]</sup></a> dancing as they sing. So the
daughter of Jephtha greeted her sire with the singing and
dancing maidens; and so in Cashmere a stranger is still
met by the women and girls of a village, who form a half
circle at the first house where he comes, join their arms,
and sing eulogies of him, dancing to the tune of the verse.
Malays and even Africans do the same.<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c012'><sup>[633]</sup></a> Again, it is in
the seventh century, and an obscure saint, Faro by name,
has won the gratitude of a community; straightway a song
is made and sung “by the women as they dance and clap
their hands.”<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c012'><sup>[634]</sup></a> It was not often that a saint’s name lent grace
to these songs of the women and saved them from clerical
wrath; the decrees of councils, the letters of bishops, refer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>perpetually to the wicked verses and diabolical dances in
which maids and even matrons indulged at the very doors
of the church. Sometimes, however, national glory covered
the shame. In the chronicle of Fabyan,<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c012'><sup>[635]</sup></a> who is here telling
no lies, it is said that after Bannockburn songs were made
and sung with a refrain “in daunces, in the carols of the
maidens and minstrels of Scotland, to the reproofe and
disdaine of Englishmen”; and Barbour,<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c012'><sup>[636]</sup></a> mentioning a fight
in Eskdale where fifty Scots defeated three hundred English
under Sir Andrew Harcla, says he will not go into details,
seeing that any one who likes may hear—</p>

<p class='c013'>One is even fain to believe that Layamon<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c012'><sup>[637]</sup></a> was thinking

</div>

<p class='c013'>That the record of these refrains is so meagre and
baffling need cause no surprise. The histories of national
literature are disappointing to the student of beginnings, for
the reason that they almost invariably<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c012'><sup>[638]</sup></a> study these beginnings
as conditioned by the habits of authorship in modern times;
they are always looking for original composition, for expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>of individual feeling, for a story, and therefore turn
aside from these stretched metres of an antique song. But
the story, and the expression of personal emotion, are precisely
what one seldom if ever finds at the beginning of a literature;
one finds there, when one finds anything, the chorus or its
deputy the refrain. The refrain was a constant element
in early Greek song, “an essential mint-mark”;<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c012'><sup>[639]</sup></a> not only
the early melic verse, but a study of the chorus<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c012'><sup>[640]</sup></a> in dramatic
survival, proves this beyond doubt, and one is amazed to
find Rosières, in the essay quoted above, saying that the
ancients, particularly the Greeks, had no need of the refrain,
and hardly used it at all. How important, on the contrary,
this refrain must have been, how it works back through the
alternate strains of chorus and solo to the throng of communal
singers and dancers, could be shown for classical
poetry, and can be proved by mediæval and modern refrains,
some already noted under the <i>vocero</i>, and others presently
to be considered in songs of labour and of the harvest. True,
the records are scanty; and the unwary historian of English
poetry in the early stage, reviewing his material, announces
that, with the exception of some insignificant charms, there
is just one poem with a refrain, the “Consolation” of
Deor, the king’s minstrel out of place,—taking, that is,
a lyric of individual and artistic reflection as the only example
of that part of poetry which above all belongs to the
communal and spontaneous expression of the throng. Recorded
poetry has here a poor tale to tell, and even that is
usually marred in the telling. Where, then, is the old refrain
of the English folk, and where was the chorus? Had they
no dances, no ballads, no communal singing? If the evidence
of ethnology from tribes and communities of men in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>every degree of culture is to be accepted, it is certain that
Englishmen of that early day had dance, ballad, chorus, and
refrain. We know that their old heathen hymns went
with the dance; and the dance means a strophic arrangement.
What, then, has become of this refrain? So far as
the old English poetry has found record at the hands of the
monk, it is in a fixed alliterative metre, without strophes,<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c012'><sup>[641]</sup></a>
suited to epic and narrative purposes, suited to recitation and
a sort of chant, but not, in its literary shape, suited to
refrain and chorus.<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c012'><sup>[642]</sup></a> One does not dance an epic, or sing
it; it is chanted or recited; and even Anglo-Saxon lyric,
barring that little song of Déor, is elegiac and highly reflective.
The refrain, says Dr. R. M. Meyer,<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c012'><sup>[643]</sup></a> is to be
assumed for oldest Germanic poetry, although it was thrown
out by the recited alliterative verse, only to come again into
recorded literature with the introduction of rime; but no one
supposes that Englishmen ceased in that interval to dance
and sing. It is a defect of the record. The chorals and
refrains, even the ballads of which William of Malmesbury
speaks as crumbling to pieces with the lapse of time, were
simply deemed useless if not harmful, and had no claim
whatever to the life beyond life. Nor is this chorus, this
refrain, simply assumed for oldest Germanic poetry; it is
proved, and nowhere proved so well as in Müllenhoff’s
essay.<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c012'><sup>[644]</sup></a> Many conclusions of this sturdy and often too intolerant
scholar have been rejected by later investigation;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>but his assertion in regard to choral poetry as the foundation
of every literature remains an article of faith among those
who deal at first hand with the material involved, and writers
since his day who have undertaken to describe the different
kinds of Germanic choral song have done little more than
follow in his steps.<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c012'><sup>[645]</sup></a> There is no need, then, to rehearse this
proof of the existence of refrain and chorus as main form<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c012'><sup>[646]</sup></a>
of poetry among the ancient Germans; it is in order simply
to trace these and other choral songs in the later fragments
and the surviving refrains, whether sung at the solemn
procession round the fields, or sung to the festal dance at harvest-home,
or in whatever survivals they may be found, and
to compare them with kindred refrains and kindred customs
elsewhere. From this point of view, even the blackness
of thick darkness which broods over Anglo-Saxon communal
song, that darkness of superstitious fear felt by
monks who knew these customs and these songs to be of
the devil himself, and would not write them down, is lifted
a little. We look, then, at refrains of labour, refrains of
actual work, too trivial usually for record, and at those refrains
and chorals of the harvest feasts, of plantings, sowings,
reapings, which had the taint of heathendom upon them, and
so were either left in silence or coaxed into a harmless formula;
we look, too, at refrains and chorus of the dance, the
sunnier side of life, and still more provocative than labour as
an occasion of communal song. For the refrains of war, and
even for the choral raised by a whole army as it marched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>to battle, an occasion which Müllenhoff calls the supreme
moment of all Germanic life, the fierce and clamorous words
needing no leader,<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c012'><sup>[647]</sup></a> and the wild rhythm asking no aid from
trumpet or drum, there is ample evidence; and indeed these
war chorals might be connected by easy stages with the
ridiculous marching songs already noted above. From the
<i>barditus</i> to “ma poule a fait un poulet” were a pretty journey;
but we will keep to the ways of peace, and the <i>saure
wochen, frohe feste</i> of everyday life will yield material
enough in regard to this communal refrain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Songs of labour are found everywhere; but there is a great
chasm between the actual refrains, the survivals of communal
or even solitary song which come from the real scene of
labour and from the real labourers, and those songs which
are made for the labourer. Nowhere is the difference between
<i>volkspoesie</i> and <i>volksthümliche poesie</i> so evident; and we have
here no concern with poetry, however successful, which has
been written for the edification of “honest toil.”<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c012'><sup>[648]</sup></a> It is the
song of actual labour to which we now turn, as it has abounded
in all the activities of life, and which, like the ballad, is fast
vanishing from the scene. Sometimes the labour was solitary,
and the song was a plaintive little lyric when it was made by
the lonely maiden grinding at her hand-mill:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Alone I ground, alone I sang,</div>
      <div class='line'>Alone I turned the mill....<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c012'><sup>[649]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>but often even this grinding of the mill was social, as in
Poland, where it was the manner of the women to repeat
a word in chorus.<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c012'><sup>[650]</sup></a> Plutarch has preserved an old Greek
“song of the millstone,”<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c012'><sup>[651]</sup></a> which he heard a woman sing;
from the older Scandinavian literature<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c012'><sup>[652]</sup></a> comes a lay, sung by
two maidens, Menja and Fenja, as they grind out King Frodi’s
fortune, which may hold bits of the actual refrain of labour,
and has, too, its touch of folklore, explaining “how the sea
became salt”; but the real and primitive choral of such
labour is sufficiently attested by those women in Poland, and
by a similar case among the Basuto tribe,<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c012'><sup>[653]</sup></a> where, as Cassilis
says, to relieve the fatigue of solitary grinding, “the women
come together and grind in unison, by singing an air which
blends perfectly with the cadenced clinking of the rings upon
their arms.” There is plenty of evidence for this choral of
the grinding women in places and times so widely sundered as
to forbid all idea of borrowing, and to leave the conditions of
communal labour and communal consent as the only explanation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Originally there was a spontaneous chorus or refrain<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c012'><sup>[654]</sup></a>—in
the strictly choral sense, that is, and not in the technical
meaning presently to be considered—suggested by the movements,
cadence, and sounds of the work itself; improvisation
added words at will, until at last art seized upon the material
and gave now a song like that of Fenja and Menja, now
even a jolly refrain such as one finds in an audacious song
of Beaumont and Fletcher’s <i>Maid of the Mill</i>.<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c012'><sup>[655]</sup></a> Everywhere
labour had its refrain and song, and even the scanty
remains of Hellenic communal poetry tell of songs for reaper,
thresher, miller, for the vintage, spinning, weaving, for the
drawers of water, oarsmen, rope-makers, watchmen, shepherds,
and for the common labourers marching out to their
work. Rome itself, in the old silent period, has something
of this song for the attentive ear;<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c012'><sup>[656]</sup></a> and allusions scattered
throughout the Bible show that the Hebrews sang at their
work in house and in field. A few echoes of such singing
come from Egypt; while darker and darkest Africa, along
with savage tribes over the world, shows yet more elementary,
and hence more insistent and necessary<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c012'><sup>[657]</sup></a> connection between
work and song. With the breaking up of communal conditions,
with the advance of individual and initiative art, these
songs of labour, like the ballad, like all communal poetry,
tend to disappear or yield to alien verse. Often the individual
works in silence, when his labour demands intelligent
thought, but where labour is automatic or monotonous, wherever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>it is collective, the labourer sings, and always will do so;
the important fact is that he now ceases to sing the old refrain
or song of the labour itself, born, as Bücher<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c012'><sup>[658]</sup></a> shows so
plainly, of the very movements and sounds which it called
forth. For good reason, <i>andere zeiten, andere lieder</i>. Neus<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c012'><sup>[659]</sup></a>
noted that the Esthonians, a century ago, sang their own
songs, and sang always as they worked in the fields or came
together for festal occasions; now,—and “now” is fifty years
ago—he says that either the song is silent, or else it is
changed for an imported German ditty. All the more need,
then, to collect and study such survivals of the refrains of
labour as can be found. Speaking of the decline of folksong
in Germany, not only of the making but even of the
singing, Professor E. H. Meyer<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c012'><sup>[660]</sup></a> remarks that collective
labour still has some power here and there to stir the old
instinct into a fitful activity. Now it is in the spinning-room,—where
Böckel<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c012'><sup>[661]</sup></a> a few years ago could hear Hessian folksongs
in the making—now at the berry-picking in Nassau,
at the flax-breaking, and elsewhere in cases where companies
of peasants still ply the monotonous tasks of their forefathers.
And in all these cases, as in the beginning, so in
the end, women are the mainstay of communal song.<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c012'><sup>[662]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Of particular trades and callings, perhaps sailors, oarsmen,
and watermen generally, would furnish more refrains than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>could be found in any one industry of the land. Sailors’ chanteys
are still heard in every ship;<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c012'><sup>[663]</sup></a> but they are now apt to echo
those songs of the street and the dance-hall which have been
picked up at port, and they have seldom a traditional interest.
Here and there, however, the genuine refrain is clear enough,
and attests itself by its power to withstand the <i>discrimina rerum</i>
and the changes of time; it is said that modern Greek sailors,
when reefing sails, have nearly the same melodious calls as
those preserved in a play of Aristophanes.<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c012'><sup>[664]</sup></a> Negro roustabouts
on the Mississippi sing interminable refrains, while a
capable leader improvises stanzas on the work in hand or on
current events; a process which is matched by refrains and
songs of manual labour in every part of the world. A well-known
passage in the <i>Complaynt of Scotland</i><a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c012'><sup>[665]</sup></a> gives the cries
and songs both of weighing anchor,—where a leader sings
and the rest answer “as it had bene ecco in an hou heuch,”
like the echo in a hollow ravine, mainly in repetitions,—and
of hoisting sail, with iteration of short running phrases such
as:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Grit and smal, grit and smal,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ane and al, ane and al,—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and not stopping here, undertakes to set down the “chorus”
of guns heavy and light as a spirited sea-fight begins. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>the old play <i>Common Conditions</i> occurs a pirates’ song, the
stanzas in quatrains, with a jolly refrain or chorus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lustely, lustely, lustely let us saile forthe,</div>
      <div class='line'>The wind trim doth serve us, it blows from the north.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Hoisting, pulling, however, and work of the sort on shipboard,
yield in importance, so far as refrains are concerned, to the
regular cadence of the oar, where voices have kept tune and
oars have kept time from earliest days. Not only in the
classical period, where actual song and music came to take
the place of the refrain,<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c012'><sup>[666]</sup></a> but with Egyptians, Africans, Tonga
Islanders, wherever rowing is practised, these refrains are
known; the Maoris, for example, “row in time with a melody
which is sung by a chorus sitting in canoes.” The same
thing is told of the Indians of Alaska.<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c012'><sup>[667]</sup></a>  A refrain already
noted seems to have served in England both for hoisting and
for rowing; Skelton mentions it:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Holde up the helme, loke up, and lete god stere,</div>
      <div class='line'>I wolde be mery, what wynde that ever blowe,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Heve and how, rombelow, row the bote, Norman, rowe</i>!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and D’Israeli says that sailors at Newcastle in heaving anchor
still have their <i>Heave and ho, rumbelow</i>; while it is recorded
that in 1453, Norman, Lord Mayor of London, chose to row
rather than ride to Westminster, and the watermen made
this roundel or song:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Rowe the bote, Norman,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rowe to thy Lemman,—<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c012'><sup>[668]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>so that two refrains are confused in the laureate’s account,
and the exquisite reason, with a Lord Mayor in the case, is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>more probable than such stories of origins are wont to be.
For example, Cnut is credited<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c012'><sup>[669]</sup></a> with a little song, which he is
said to have composed as he rowed by Ely and heard the chanting
of the monks; “ordering the rowers to pull gently, and
calling his retinue about him, he asked them to join him ...
in singing a ballad which he composed in English and which
begins in this way:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Merie sungen the muneches binnen Ely,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tha Cnut ching rew ther by.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Roweth, cnihtës, noer the land,</div>
      <div class='line'>And herë we thes muneches sang.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Several things here are noteworthy; both Grundtvig and
Rosenberg have pointed out<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c012'><sup>[670]</sup></a> that this song is composed in a
two-line ballad strophe of four accents to the verse, the kind
afterward so common in Scandinavia and in England; and
whatever Cnut’s share in the making of it, it is at least of the
eleventh century, and is the first recorded piece of verse to
break away from the regular stichic metre of our oldest
poetry. Moreover, it is said that Cnut improvised the song,
and that he called on the others to join him; the lines quoted
then, so Grundtvig infers, are the burden or chorus of the
song itself; and it is interesting to know that in the days
of the chronicler, say about the middle of the twelfth century,
this refrain as well as the song was sung in the choral dances
of the English folk. Doubtless it was sung to the oar itself;
and that may have been the first of it, with royalty as an
afterthought.<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c012'><sup>[671]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Coming to land, one would think that the blacksmith,
rhythmic as his work may be, must have little breath to
spare for song; and, indeed, Bücher could find but one
specimen which seemed to hold the genuine rhythm of the
anvil. Had he looked to the English, however, he would
have met more; an old “Satire on the Blacksmiths”<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c012'><sup>[672]</sup></a> preserves
a refrain probably sung to the work itself, or, at
worst, imitated from its cadence:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thei gnaven and gnacchen, thei gronys togydere....</div>

      <div class='line'><i>Lus! bus! Las! das!</i> swych lyf thei ledyn.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>St. Clement is the patron of blacksmiths, and while Brand’s
account of the festivities gives no refrain, but only poor
doggerel and mimicry, it is clear that processions, songs, and
dances were a feature of the saint’s day,<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c012'><sup>[673]</sup></a> once regarded as
the beginning of winter; so that communal origins may even
lurk in the traditional anvil song, quoted by Dickens,<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c012'><sup>[674]</sup></a> “that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>imitated the measure of beating upon iron, and was a mere
lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem’s respected
name”:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hammer, boys, round—Old Clem,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a thump and a sound—Old Clem.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Again, there is the tinker with his catches, which moved
Overbury<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c012'><sup>[675]</sup></a> to a theory of origins; “from his art was music
first invented, and therefore is he alwaies furnished with a
song,” to which his hammer keeps time. Of course, the
only point of interest in these songs of the trades is the
survival of a refrain which carries the sound and cadence of
the work itself. Thus in the old play of <i>Tom Tiler and his
Wife</i>, it is probable that an actual refrain has crept into the
lively song of which Dame Strife sings the first staff, with its</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>clearly an echo from the roof. But there is more of the
communal strain in spinning-songs;<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c012'><sup>[676]</sup></a> for here is the home
of balladry, a city of refuge even to this day,<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c012'><sup>[677]</sup></a> and here the
women make as well as sing the song. Echoes of the wheel
itself<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c012'><sup>[678]</sup></a> are not infrequent; perhaps they are too close to art
in that pretty song of sewing, knitting, and spinning, sung
by three women in the first act of <i>Roister Doister</i>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c013'>although, what with incremental repetition in other stanzas,
and the audible whir of the wheel, this is like the songs
which still move women to emulation under like circumstances
in the spinning-rooms of Europe. “In Northamptonshire,

sing?—</p>

<p class='c013'>Slightly different is the song of Peterborough workhouse

in the Greenside Wakes Song:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Tread the wheel, tread the wheel, dan, don, dell O.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The flyting that goes with this refrain is negligible,—a man
and a woman on horseback with spinning-wheels before
them, singing alternate stanzas in the midst of the fair, with
its dancing and merriment, a sort of side-show; but the
refrain may well be old.</p>

<p class='c013'>Songs of the crafts, however, are less likely to hold the
festal, gregarious, communal note than those old refrains
which took their cadence from the movements of workers in
the field. An agricultural community, whether in its rudest
stages, a horde that lives in fertile river bottoms as distinguished
from the nomadic, predatory bands of the plain, or
in the civilization of feudal Europe, always tends to homogeneous
conditions and always fosters communal song.
Where these conditions survive, this song in some degree
survives with them. Corsican labourers in the field, says
Ortoli,<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c012'><sup>[683]</sup></a> still sing so at their work; the Styrian threshers,
eight together, make their flails chorus thus:—</p>

<p class='c013'>while Silesians, with two, three, four, five, six, hear as many
different refrains made by the strokes of the flail;<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c012'><sup>[684]</sup></a> and
Bladé<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c012'><sup>[685]</sup></a> prints a song of Gascon peasants which seems to give
again all the stages in the culture of the vine,—a stanza or

refrain:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Early English drama was evidently fond of songs not unlike
this, and in <i>Summer’s Last Will and Testament</i> Nash brings
harvesters on the scene singing what appears to be a song of
harvest-home, if one may judge by the refrain of <i>Hooky,
Hooky</i>, said by a Dodsley editor<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c012'><sup>[687]</sup></a> to be heard still in some parts
of the kingdom. “Enter Harvest,” run the directions, “with
a scythe on his neck, and all his reapers with sickles, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>great black bowl with a posset in it, come before him; they
come in singing:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>Merry, merry, merry, cheary, cheary, cheary,</div>

      <div class='line'><i>Hooky, hooky,<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c012'><sup>[688]</sup></a> we have shorn,</i></div>

      <div class='line in2'><i>And we have brought Harvest</i></div>
      <div class='line in6'><i>Home to town.”</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The tendency to put popular and traditional songs into a play
was common everywhere. Hans Sachs<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c012'><sup>[689]</sup></a> used a May-song
for the ring-dance which is clearly made in its turn out of a
lusty old refrain:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Der Mei, der Mei,</div>
      <div class='line'>Der bringt uns blümlein vil.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Best of all, however, George Peele, who in his <i>Old Wives’
Tale</i> gives tryst to countless waifs of folklore and popular
stories, makes room there for a pretty song of harvesters.
“Ten to one,” cries Madge, when they first enter upon the
stage, “they sing a song of mowing,” but they are sowing, it
seems; and once again they come in, this time with a song
of harvest. The present writer has ventured<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c012'><sup>[690]</sup></a> to change the
first song so as to make it agree with the second, not an audacious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>feat when one considers the case. The songs, with an
interval between, would then run as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lo, here we come a-sowing, a-sowing,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And sow sweet fruits of love.</div>
      <div class='line'>All that lovers be, pray you for me,—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In your sweethearts well may it prove.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lo, here<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c012'><sup>[691]</sup></a> we come a-reaping, a-reaping,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To reap our harvest fruit;</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus we pass the year so long,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And never be we mute.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The refrain is easy to detach from the rest; and it is clear,
too, that actual imitation of sowing, reaping, binding, often
went with the song, probably in this case a combination of
gesture and word known still in games of modern children.</p>

<p class='c013'>These songs, particularly the Gascon vintage chorus, are
simply a festal recapitulation of the rustic year, with more or
less echo of actual refrain sung to the labour in its various
stages. From the moment when communal labour began to
sow the seed—in Japan<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c012'><sup>[692]</sup></a> the peasants still plant their rice
in cadence with a chorus, and in Cashmere<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c012'><sup>[693]</sup></a> the onions are
sown with accompaniment of “a long-drawn, melancholy song,”—through
process after process, down to the picking,<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c012'><sup>[694]</sup></a> reaping,
harvesting, and so to the festal imitations just noted, even to
the ritual of priestly thanksgiving, every stage is marked by
communal singing, except that in the function last named the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>community turns passive, the guild replaces the throng, and
art has begun its course. Hence it is that most of the survivals
of song and refrain come down to our day with more
or less magic in the case. Rites are performed by the head
of a family, and are even transferred from the field to the
home; as when<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c012'><sup>[695]</sup></a> at flax-planting a German wife springs about
the hearth and cries, “Heads as big as my head, leaves as big
as my apron, and stalks as thick as my leg!” In Silesia,<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c012'><sup>[696]</sup></a>
again, husband and wife sing together a song with the
refrain,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Om Floxe, om Floxe, om Floxe!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Even in the field itself, song is mingled with these symbolical
and even religious rites; incantations, such as that Anglo-Saxon
charm<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c012'><sup>[697]</sup></a> for making barren or bewitched land bear
again, are strongly tinged with clerical lore, and in this case
involve a visit to the church altar. The Romans, too, had
spells and charms for restoring fields to fertility when other
spells and charms had bewitched them; harmful rites of this
sort were forbidden in the laws of the twelve tables.<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c012'><sup>[698]</sup></a> Corruption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>is rife in these things; but in a charm<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c012'><sup>[699]</sup></a> for the old
English peasant to get back his strayed or stolen cattle, amid
the hocus-pocus of Herod and Judas and the holy rood and
scraps of Latin, a few lines echo the old repetition, but have
no refrain:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>find the fee<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c012'><sup>[700]</sup></a> and drive the fee,</div>
      <div class='line'>and have the fee and hold the fee,</div>
      <div class='line'>and drive home the fee.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A thousand things of the sort survive, but seldom touch the
refrain; perhaps the charm to make butter come from the
churn, common in 1655,<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c012'><sup>[701]</sup></a> had a choral element:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Come, butter, come!</div>
      <div class='line'>Come, butter, come!</div>
      <div class='line'>Peter stands at the gate</div>
      <div class='line'>Waiting for a butter’d cake,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Come, butter, come!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We turn back to the actual labour of the fields, and the
songs and refrains that went with it. A refrain<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c012'><sup>[702]</sup></a> has come
down to us from the harvesters of ancient Hellas,—“Sing
the sheaf-song, the sheaf-song, the song of the sheaf,” which
is not unlike the type just considered in George Peele’s “Lo,
here we come a-reaping”; while that waif of Germanic
myth,<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c012'><sup>[703]</sup></a> the story of Scéaf, where the “sheaf” is made the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>name of an agricultural god, or culture-hero, as one will,
reminds us of Phrygian countryfolk who at their reaping
sang “in mournful wise” the song of Lityerses, itself said
to be the outcome of an old refrain, lapsing into a <i>vocero</i> for
the hero’s death. Burlesque laid unholy hands upon the
custom and the myth; the story growing out of the song
passed into a tradition which coldly furnished forth the satire
and comedy of a later day; since any song of the harvest-field
or the threshing-floor came to be called a Lityerses,<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c012'><sup>[704]</sup></a> the
name was seized upon for certain comic features, and grew
to be a symbol of an insatiable eater. Yet dramatic allusions
and uses of more serious nature, like the song recorded by
Peele, were doubtless common in Greece and throughout the
Orient. It has been said already, in speaking of the <i>vocero</i>,
that the song of Maneros was sung by Egyptian reapers,
just as they sang on the threshing-floor the song of the oxen
treading out the corn; while at the harvest-home Greek husbandmen,
if Mannhardt’s surmise<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c012'><sup>[705]</sup></a> is right, sang a variant of
the Maneros; and Homer is witness for the singing of the
Linos at the time of vintage.<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c012'><sup>[706]</sup></a> If, now, one seeks for similar
songs in the fields of modern Europe, one finds, to be sure,
hints in plenty, descriptions by this and that traveller, and
fragments of actual verse; but conditions of religious ceremonial
have broken up the old refrains and barred any handing
down of a Germanic Linos or Lityerses. Customs, too,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>have changed; and few are the places where folk at harvest-home
do as their forbears did, when “the whole family sat
down at the same table, and conversed, danced, and sang
together during the entire night without difference or distinction
of any kind” as between master and man, mistress
and maid.<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c012'><sup>[707]</sup></a> Add to the case that great transfer of vital
interests upon which economists lay such stress, from open-air
life to home-life, from the throng with its indiscriminate
dance and merriment, often, too, its indiscriminate morals,
its communal habit of thought and expression, to the individual
responsibility, the sober pleasures and the stricter
morals of the fireside, from the delight in movement, noise,
cadence of many voices, to lamplight and the printed page
and meditation: add this to the account, and one sees how
ill it must have fared with the communal refrain of work,
feast, and ceremonial rite. Reactions come, of course, and
no one denies a constant market for cakes and ale; but what
is a church fair, even a camp-meeting, to the old vigil? The
wife of Bath is still with us, but she has to make shift with
an afternoon tea. Disintegration, due to the lapse of communal
feeling, has either broken up the traditional refrains,
leaving only <i>Hooky, hooky</i>,<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c012'><sup>[708]</sup></a> and unmeaning things of the
kind, or else has favoured the making of doggerel which
may or may not mean something, and which in any case
threatens the student with perils of a too curious interpretation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>of chops and tomato-sauce. Even where there is
neither corruption nor distortion, there is unblushing if often
innocent substitution of modern mawkishness. Precisely as
one boggles, when reading Herd’s <i>Scottish Songs</i>, to find
under the title “I wish my Love were in a Myre” the familiar
translation of Sappho’s “Blest as the Immortal Gods,”—so,
in coming to the “Cornish Midsummer Bonfire Song,” in
Bell’s collection, a title to make any student of communal
poetry get out a fresh pen, and in reading, too, that here
“fishermen and others dance about the fire and sing appropriate
songs,” one pulls up with a rude shock at—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hail! lovely nymphs, be not too coy,</div>
      <div class='line'>But freely yield your charms,<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c012'><sup>[709]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>which, while appropriate in sentiment, has not the note of
simplicity that one expects from Cornish fishermen dancing
round the bonfire of heathen tradition. True, this is a very
bad counterfeit; but many a verse quite as alien at heart, if
not on the face, has been foisted upon communal and traditional
song.</p>

<p class='c013'>The best survivals come from the harvest field, and mingle
refrain with improvisation. Very common in old times and
in new is the note of ridicule, particularly for the wayfaring
man, converted temporarily into a fool, who passes by the
labourers; such a man even now gets rude handling as well
as rude rimes, and this was the case in Hellas.<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c012'><sup>[710]</sup></a> In an often-quoted
Idyll of Ausonius there is reference to the exchange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>of abusive lyric compliments between workers in the field and
the boatmen on the Moselle; while any one can note how
this instinct for a flyting between labourers in a band and the
<i>spectator ab extra</i>, alone or in company, holds always and
everywhere, while, on the other hand, the solitary labourer
and the solitary wanderer are wont to pass the time of day
with full courtesy and often with an inexplicably kindly feeling.
German peasants breaking flax in the fields still sing to the
rhythm of their strokes; as in the old days, a stranger who
passes by them is sure to be hailed in improvised verses not of
a complimentary kind. Particularly if the stranger be a young
gentleman, a possible suitor for one of the daughters at the
great house, sarcastic song greets him from twenty or thirty
throats, mainly a refrain, and that partly of an imitative
character, with derisive lines like:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Too fat is he quite,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he isn’t polite,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>with the refrain for conclusion,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hurrah, let him go!<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c012'><sup>[711]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>All this, of course, to the exact time of the work in hand.
When no stranger offers, mutual flytings will serve. Near
Soest all the young people shout and sing throughout the entire
process of preparing flax,—“unsung flax,” they say, “is good
for nothing,”—and songs are improvised in satire of one another,
with a refrain <i>rummel dumm dum</i> or <i>rem sen jo jo</i>.
Travelling in Wales, by the bye, had once these chances of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>satire, and Aubrey tells about them, thinking doubtless of his
favourite time “before the civil warres.” For in Wales there
were not only “rymers ... that upon any subject given
would versify extempore halfe an hour together,” but “the
vulgar sort of people ... have a humour of singing extempore
upon occasion: <i>e.g.</i> a certain gentleman coming to ——,
the woemen that were washing at ye river fell all a singing in
Welsh, wʰ was a description of ye men and their horses.”<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c012'><sup>[712]</sup></a>
How facile the black fellows of Australia, Africans, and savages
everywhere, can be with this improvised ridicule, mainly
practised on the march, or at some sort of labour, all travellers
testify. Samoans sing instead of talking “as they walk
along the road, or paddle the canoe, or do any other piece of
work. These songs often contain sarcastic remarks, and in
passing the house or village of parties with whom they are
displeased, they strike up a chant embodying some offensive
ideas.”<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c012'><sup>[713]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>We must keep to the harvest fields. Wordsworth’s solitary
reaper called forth an exquisite lyric; but there is
material more attractive for the student of refrains, however
it lack poetic merit, in Boswell’s and Johnson’s stories of
a Highland harvest, and one would be glad indeed if the
doctor, who had all of Wordsworth’s curiosity on this point,
could have made the reapers tell him what they sang.<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c012'><sup>[714]</sup></a> He
was coming close to Rasay in a boat, while, as Boswell
says, the boatmen “sang with great spirit,” and Johnson remarked
that “naval music was very ancient”;<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c012'><sup>[715]</sup></a> then the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>men were silent, and from the near fields was heard the
song of reapers, “<i>who seemed to shout as much as to sing</i>,
while they worked with a <i>bounding activity</i>.” Johnson’s
own account<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c012'><sup>[716]</sup></a> of reaping on Rasay may refer to this or to
another occasion. “I saw,” he says, “the harvest of a small
field. The women reaped the corn, and the men bound up
the sheaves. The strokes of the sickle were timed by the
modulations of the harvest-song in which all their voices
were united. They accompany in the Highlands every
action which can be done in equal time with an appropriate
strain, which has, they say, not much meaning;<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c012'><sup>[717]</sup></a> but
its effects are regularity and cheerfulness.” These hints
from the Highlands are of peculiar importance because of
the undoubted homogeneous conditions of life in the clans,
keeping songs of this sort in an almost primitive state.
Significant is the rhythm of shouts, significant the preponderance
of the refrain. Lady Rasay showed Johnson “the
operation of <i>wawking</i> cloth. Here it is performed by women
who kneel upon the ground and rub it with both their hands,
singing an Erse song all the time.” Boswell speaks of their
“loud and wild howl”; and Dr. Hill<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c012'><sup>[718]</sup></a> quotes Lockhart that
women at this work screamed “all the while in a sort of
chorus. At a distance the sound was wild and sweet
enough, but rather discordant” at close quarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Lowlands of Scotland, too, had their <i>kirn</i>,<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c012'><sup>[719]</sup></a> and the
English harvest-home, practically the same thing, had merry
songs and refrains down to living memory. What must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>these songs have been, when, if Professor Skeat<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c012'><sup>[720]</sup></a> is right in
his estimate and inference, on one estate of two hundred
acres in Suffolk no less than five hundred and fifty-three
persons were assembled for harvest? At almost any period
of English country life one finds the rural philosopher
looking back, like the Rev. Dr. Jessopp now,<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c012'><sup>[721]</sup></a> to kindlier and
more communal times, greater harvests, keener jollity, a wider
and deeper social sense; so Overbury’s franklin felt that
he held a brief for the <i>tempus actum</i>. “He allows of
honest pastime, and thinkes not the bones of the dead anything
bruised, or the worse for it, though the country lasses
dance in the churchyard after even-song. Rocke Monday,
and the wake in summer, shrovings, the wakefull ketches
on Christmas eve, the hoky or seed-cake, these he yearly
keepes.” Of this festal round harvest-home was culmination,
since it knitted the bond between labour and rest,
and was the pledge of plenty, the high tide of the agricultural
year. Three elements may be noted in this harvest-home
so far as the refrain is concerned; first, the shouting,
the choral cries and songs of the labourers in the field as
the last sheaf is cut and bound; secondly, the march homeward
with the hock-cart to the cadence of loud refrains and
songs, with the thrice-repeated procession about barn and
yard; and thirdly, the more elaborate ceremonial of those
gatherings which marked the safe accomplishment of harvest.
Moreover, in any of these cases a progress may be
noted from the rude but cadenced shouts, the refrains and
chorals, through definite songs of harvest, up to all manner
of offshoots and distortions,—fixed rites, speeches, sermons,
pantomime, beggings, what not; but even in the last and
worse estate of the communal harvest-song there is everywhere
echo of the refrain, everywhere echo of the dance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>The breaking up of communal labour has left mainly the
songs and cries of working folk on any given farm or
estate; but the songs of a common festival for harvested
crops still linger in customs of the village,—now a traditional
march of the elder folk, now some half-understood
dance and walk of the maidens, such as Hardy
describes in his <i>Tess</i>, and now a mere song of village
children coming in a band from the search for berries, as
in the Black Forest:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Holla, holla, reera,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mer kumme us d’Beere.<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c012'><sup>[722]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Lithuanians coming back from the field, or in any communal
gathering, when they have sung through their traditional
stock of songs, call for a new ditty; amid jest and
jollity some one strikes up a <i>daina</i> of his own, composing
as he sings; the rest repeat in chorus, correct the words,
add to them,—and so a new song is made, and, if it finds
favour, is handed down, and even passed to the neighbour
villages. This custom, however, is fast going out of date.<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c012'><sup>[723]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In some places the day when harvest begins is still a
time of communal and ritual importance; Würtemberg
reapers, men and women, gather in the early dawn and sing
a choral for blessing on their work.<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c012'><sup>[724]</sup></a> As they go to the
field, the throng still sing choruses, improvised verses, and
traditional ballads; and when they march home at dusk to
their village, they sing songs, often modern enough, but, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Pfannenschmid points out, substitutes for older and doubtless
far more communal singing, which indeed lingers in
the unintelligible refrain. In many places, however, chorus,
refrain and song, whether communal or alien, to be sung at
harvest and threshing, are dying out or dead; in Normandy,
says Beaurepaire,<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c012'><sup>[725]</sup></a> at the <i>fête de la gerbe</i>, when the last of
the wheat is threshed, no song of any sort is heard, though
elsewhere the festival is loud with chorus. A scrap of the
refrain sung in another part of France—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ho! batteux, battons la gerbe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Battons-la joyeusement, ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Beaurepaire heard, to be sure, here and there in Normandy;
but it was no longer a refrain of labour, and was attached
to a love-song.<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c012'><sup>[726]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The main ceremony, of course, is at the end of harvest. In
many places a custom still prevails, that when the last sheaf
is to be cut, a portion of grain is left standing, and the reapers
now dance about it with repeated cries, sometimes of vague
mythological tradition like “Wold, Wold, Wold,” and with
songs; now bare their heads, and pour food and drink upon
the spot; now let the “bonniest lass” cut this remnant, dress
it, and bring it home as the “corn-baby”; now throw their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>sickles at it to see who can cut it down;<a id='r727' /><a href='#f727' class='c012'><sup>[727]</sup></a> and so on, in variety
of form, but all to the same purpose. In Flanders they sing,
when the last load is taken from the field,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Keriole, keriole, al in!</div>
      <div class='line'>’t loaste voer goat in.</div>
      <div class='line'>Keriole, Keriole, al in!<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c012'><sup>[728]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is every reason to think that some rite of this sort,
accompanied with communal refrain and song, was once
universal in agricultural life.<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c012'><sup>[729]</sup></a> The corn-baby just described
as decked in silk and ribbons and brought home with singing,
is also known as the kirn-baby, the ivy-girl, and the
maiden; so that harvest-home is here and there called the
maiden-feast.<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c012'><sup>[730]</sup></a> The songs belong primarily on the field and
with the homeward faring cart; but customs change. In
Suffolk at harvest suppers some one is crowned with a pillow
and the folk all sing <i>I am the Duke of Norfolk</i>,<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c012'><sup>[731]</sup></a> though
elsewhere in the country the old note remains. Still farther
from the field, Hertfordshire countrymen sing <i>The Barley
Mow</i> in alehouses after their day’s labour; but in another
part of Suffolk this is a festal song chanted at the harvest-supper
“when the stack, rick, or mow of barley is finished.”
It is a song of repetitions, and holds an old refrain.<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c012'><sup>[732]</sup></a> For this
song at the harvest-home supper, its variations, corruptions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>survivals, its refrains, and its choruses, one would need a
book; a description or two of recent doings must suffice.
“At the harvest suppers up to some twenty years ago,”
say Broadwood and Maitland, “while the other guests were
still seated at the table, a labourer carrying a jug or can of
beer or cider filled a horn for every two men, one on each
side of the table; as they drank, this old harvest-song was
sung and the chorus repeated, until the man with the beer
had reached the end of the long table, involving sometimes
thirty repetitions of the first verse. After this, the second
verse was sung in the same manner.” The chorus—from
Wiltshire—ran thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So drink, boys, drink, and see that you do not spill,</div>
      <div class='line'>For if you do, you shall drink two, for ’tis our master’s will.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>What is left here of communal song is the fact of the
chorus and the infinite repetition; the song has a poor mixture
of the bucolic with the buckish. The older collection of
Dixon gives a better song:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Our oats they are howed and our barley’s reaped,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our hay is mowed and our hovels heaped,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Harvest Home! Harvest Home!</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll merrily roar out Harvest Home!</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Harvest Home! Harvest Home!</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>with another repetition of the line.<a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c012'><sup>[733]</sup></a> The men who sang this
chorus were still in thrall to an old custom at the barley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>harvest. On putting up the last sheaf, which is called the
craw, or crow sheaf, the man who has it cries out,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I have it, I have it, I have it!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Another asks,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What hav’ee, what hav’ee, what hav’ee?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And the answer comes,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A craw, a craw, a craw!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Then wild cheering, and off they go to the supper, where they
sing a well-known cumulative song about the brown bowl, the
quarter-pint, the half-pint, and so on.</p>

<p class='c013'>These repeated cries, however, take us back to the field. In
Devon, as Brand relates, they still cried “the neck”; a little
bundle was made from the best ears of the sheaves, and when
the last field was reaped, all gathered about the person who
had this neck, who first stooped and held it near the ground.
All the men doffed their hats and held them likewise and
then cried, in a very prolonged and harmonious tone, <i>The
Neck</i>, at the same time raising themselves upright, and elevating
arms and hats above their heads, the holder of the
neck doing likewise. This was done thrice; after which they
changed their cry to <i>wee yen</i>,<a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c012'><sup>[734]</sup></a> <i>way yen</i>, prolonged as before, and
also sounded thrice; then boisterous laughter, amidst which
they break up and hurry to the farmhouse,—a maimed rite,
indeed, but of interest when compared with kindred doings.
For the words are surely wreckage of an old refrain, full of
repetitions, like that song Montanus rescued from the rites
of midsummer-eve along the Rhine. Under the “crown,”
boys, girls, and their elders dance in a ring and sing as they
dance a sort of refrain which is made of incremental repetitions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>into a description of the game they are playing; meantime
one person stands in the midst of the ring until he has
played his part to the choral suggestion, a common element
in other games of children. In these and kindred ceremonies
it is clear that a concerted shouting was the main feature,
but the shouts were rhythmical and went with the communal
dance, not with a disintegrated, howling mob. At Hitchin
farmers drove furiously home with the last load of harvest,
while the people rushed madly after, shouting and dashing
bowls of water on the corn; but this is chaotic, for old Tusser<a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c012'><sup>[735]</sup></a>
knew a better way:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Come home lord singing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Come home corn bringing.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In Germany the last load of grain is brought home with
throwing of water and singing of traditional songs and shouts
for the master. So too in English “youling,” when cider is
thrown on the apple trees, at each cup “the company sets up a
shout.”<a id='r736' /><a href='#f736' class='c012'><sup>[736]</sup></a> Doubtless the elaborate chorus of the Arval brothers
had once its wild but cadenced shout of the whole festal
throng, as they “beat the ground” in communal consent of
voice and step; and this primitive shout recurs in all folksong,
not only in the <i>schnaderhüpfl</i>, in the <i>jodel</i> which ends
a stanza, but in those cries at the dance which have crept
into the ballad itself. But the cadenced shout, the refrain,
the infinite repetition of a traditional song, pass with the
dance that timed them, and decorous reapers may now depute
one of their number to act as spokesman; hence, as in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Mecklenburg, the recited poem, or the little speech, or even,
as in Hanover, a figure made of the stalks is furnished with
a letter to be read aloud for the behoof of neighbours; and
there are other infamies of the sort. So passes the old Harvest-home.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of vast importance for agricultural life, and resonant with
refrain and song, were those processions about the field, about
parish boundaries, to sacred wells,<a id='r737' /><a href='#f737' class='c012'><sup>[737]</sup></a> to woods and groves to
bring in the May, and for a hundred other purposes to a
hundred other resorts. The solemn procession of a community,
along with the festal dance, forms the oldest known
source of poetry; and Kögel points out that in German even
now the proper word for celebrating a festal occasion is <i>begehen</i>,
while the corresponding noun is used in a mediæval gloss
for <i>ritus</i> and <i>cultus</i>. The song of the Arval brothers had its
origin in such a procession about the fields; and Vergil’s
advice<a id='r738' /><a href='#f738' class='c012'><sup>[738]</sup></a> to the farmer shows that this rite was no monopoly
of priests, or even of the man skilled in incantations, but a
communal affair,—marching round the young crops, and
dance and song at harvest:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>... thrice for luck</div>
      <div class='line'>Around the young corn let the victim go,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the choir, a joyful company,</div>
      <div class='line'>Attend it, and with shouts bid Ceres come</div>
      <div class='line'>To be their house-mate; and let no man dare</div>
      <div class='line'>Put sickle to the ripened ears until,</div>
      <div class='line'>With woven oak his temples chapleted,</div>
      <div class='line'>He foot the rugged dance and chant the lay.<a id='r739' /><a href='#f739' class='c012'><sup>[739]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>There can be no question of borrowing in these songs and
dances, even in the simpler forms of ritual, which are found
wherever rudest agriculture has begun. Doubtless only a
change of religion deprives us of those songs, or some echo
of them, which were sung in the famous procession of Nerthus,<a id='r740' /><a href='#f740' class='c012'><sup>[740]</sup></a>
the <i>terra mater</i>, goddess of fertility and peace among
the Germanic tribes who lived by the northern oceans two
thousand years ago. These people, so Tacitus<a id='r741' /><a href='#f741' class='c012'><sup>[741]</sup></a> records the
rite, “believe that she enters into human activity, and travels
among them.” Drawn by cows, she is accompanied in her
mysterious wagon by a priest; “those are joyful times and
places which the goddess honours with her presence, and her
visit makes holiday.”<a id='r742' /><a href='#f742' class='c012'><sup>[742]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Tacitus was interested in the mysteries of the rite; would
that he had heard and transmitted the songs that rang out in
honour of this German Demeter, and had described the dances
of the folk about their fields!<a id='r743' /><a href='#f743' class='c012'><sup>[743]</sup></a> For, as Kögel points out, the
later procession to bless crops and to ban all things hostile to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>their thriving, a custom still common in certain parts of Europe,
is only a repetition of this old progress. Half-way
between the time of Nerthus and the present occurs that
Anglo-Saxon charm for making barren or bewitched land
bear fruit; amid its excrescences of ritual, and under the
alien matter, still lingers a hint of the old communal procession,
the old communal song and dance; and perhaps Nerthus
is dimly remembered in the cries of,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Erce, Erce, Erce, earth’s mother,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>which has a repetition familiar from many survivals,<a id='r744' /><a href='#f744' class='c012'><sup>[744]</sup></a> and in
the lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hail to thee, Earth, all men’s mother,</div>
      <div class='line'>Be thou growing in God’s protection,</div>
      <div class='line'>Filled with food for feeding of men!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Again, one has the extremes of shouts, communal cadenced
cries, and songs which are often quite irrelevant; thus in
Brandenburg on Easter Monday girls march by long rows,
hand in hand, over the young corn of each field, singing Easter
songs, while the young men ring the church bells;<a id='r745' /><a href='#f745' class='c012'><sup>[745]</sup></a> but one
learns that Wends of the fifteenth century greeted the early
corn as they ran round it in wild procession, and hailed it
“with loud shouting.”<a id='r746' /><a href='#f746' class='c012'><sup>[746]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>About the year 1133, and along the lower Rhine, a procession
was in vogue which may have been a survival of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>worship of that goddess recorded by Tacitus and called Isis
because her symbol was a ship; for in the mediæval rite such
a ship was placed on wheels and carried about the country,
followed by shouting bands and hailed at every halt with
song and dance.<a id='r747' /><a href='#f747' class='c012'><sup>[747]</sup></a> The songs, <i>turpia cantica et religioni Christianae
indigna concinentium</i>, were condemned by clericals,<a id='r748' /><a href='#f748' class='c012'><sup>[748]</sup></a>
and the dances of scantily clad women, not unlike the festal
dances of savage women in many places at this season of the
year, were doubtless not only intrinsically objectionable, but
pointed back to the heathen doings from which our Germanic
folk were so slowly converted. A glimpse at this older worship
is given by Gregory in his often-quoted story of the
Langobards who offered a goat’s head to their “devil,” running
about in a circle and singing impious songs.<a id='r749' /><a href='#f749' class='c012'><sup>[749]</sup></a> A survival
of some such heathen rite, with ridiculous perversion of
Christian legend, is the feast of the ass, the festival of fools,
on Christmas or on St. Stephen’s day, when during mass
the priest brays thrice and the congregation respond in kind;
here and there, as in France, a hymn is sung, with refrain
from the throng:<a id='r750' /><a href='#f750' class='c012'><sup>[750]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hez, Sir Ane, hez!—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and ending in what Hampson oddly calls “an imitation of
the noisy Bacchanalian cry of <i>Evohe!</i>”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Hez va! Hez va! Hez-va-he!</div>

      <div class='line'>Belle bouche car chantez,—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>a very far cry, indeed. After service, crowds marched
through the streets, sang Fescennine songs, danced, and
ended by “dashing pails of water over the precentor’s
head.” It is needless to follow this degenerate choral over
Europe, as it blends thus with rites of the church, passes into
the song of the waits, and lingers in degraded form with the
beggars or children who parade the countryside at Martinmas
or in Christmas week, singing refrains that echo older
and better song and doggerel that echoes nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most stubborn, of course, is this converted or Christian survival,
and almost as stubborn the custom of the village and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>of remote agricultural communities; such a procession as
Coussemaker<a id='r753' /><a href='#f753' class='c012'><sup>[753]</sup></a> describes, popular throughout Flanders and
Brabant, with a fixed refrain, held its place even in the cities.
Occasionally Church and State were opposed;<a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c012'><sup>[754]</sup></a> a proclamation
of Henry VIII forbade processions “with songes and
dances from house to house,” and even carols were forbidden
by act of Parliament in Scotland. Wakes<a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c012'><sup>[755]</sup></a> were either abolished,
or else passed into that curious communal revival, the
love-feast and the watch-meeting of Methodists. But the
communal song and procession are fast dying out, and
the new century will hear little of them; although early in
the old century the Christmas days<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c012'><sup>[756]</sup></a> heard many a shouting
throng, now with cries of <i>an guy</i>, now <i>gut heil</i>, now <i>hogmenay
trololay, give us your white bread and none of your gray</i>!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>and whatever other etymological puzzles the scanty records
can show. These fragments of festal song are too far
gone in corruption for profitable use. Aubrey<a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c012'><sup>[757]</sup></a> felt the lapse,
and made such <i>memoranda</i> as these: “get the Christmas
caroll and the wasselling song;” “get the song which is
sung in the ox-house when they wassell the oxen,” that is,
with echo of an old refrain, where they drink “to the ox with
the crumpled horne that treads out the corne”; and he has
noted a few of these songs. The civil wars, he thinks, made
an end of these old customs; “warres doe not only extinguish
Religion and Lawes, but Superstition; and no suffimen
is a greater fugator of Phantosmes than gunpowder.” But
peace has its victories of this sort. Not long ago the procession
about village and parish boundaries was common
enough; the whole community took part in this festal affair,
and all sense as of an individual purpose or individual ownership
was laid aside. Shout, dance, song, banquet, even directly
ceremonial acts, were the concern of a homogeneous throng,
“our village” in strictest communal sense. On the march—for
example, the boundary march at Hamelin, in the late
autumn,—rose traditional songs, varied by noise of every
sort; and at the feast which followed, gentle and simple
joined hands in the dance, until, with recent innovations, the
gentry withdrew, became mere onlookers, and at last left the
old rite to fall, like most communal traditions, into a shabby,
vulgar, discredited uproar of the lower classes, a thing common
and unclean. A quite similar case of degeneration is
quoted by Brand from the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for June,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>1790, as going on at Helstone in Cornwall.<a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c012'><sup>[758]</sup></a> But where the
prosperity of crop and barn is in question, the rites are more
stubborn and hold their ground. This Helstone song welcomes
summer; but before that was sung, processions of
all kinds were wont to go about the fields, and in 1868 what
the <i>Times</i> newspaper called a “ritualistic revival” came off
in Lancashire, priest and choir making a progress through
the fields with cross and banners, and singing as they went.
Rogation week is still known as gang-week.<a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c012'><sup>[759]</sup></a> In older times
the community itself was priest and choir; the cases are
plentiful and may be read in Brand’s account of “parochial
perambulations.” Then there is the song of bringing home
the May,<a id='r760' /><a href='#f760' class='c012'><sup>[760]</sup></a> the dance and song about the Maypole, with material
and survival beyond one’s compass; enough to let them
echo in the verses put by Nash into his chaotic but pretty
play, where the clowns and maids sing as they dance:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Trip and goe, heave and hoe,</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>The voices of the real maying folk are here, and the steps,
lightly touched by art in the transfer to the play; in that
Furry-Day Song at Helstone, with its opening about Robin
Hood and Little John, there is a rougher but less effective
refrain:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With ha-lau-tow, rumble O!</div>

      <div class='line'>For summer is a-come O!</div>
      <div class='line'>And winter is a-gone O!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>What the poet can do with a fragment of communal song, with
a heart full of communal sympathy, and with that final touch
of art and individual reflection, may be felt by any one who
will read in the echo of this rough old chorus those exquisite
verses of Herrick to Corinna.</p>

<p class='c013'>Songs that may pass as communal drama hold something
of this old refrain of labour; so, for example, in the flytings
of winter with summer or with spring,<a id='r763' /><a href='#f763' class='c012'><sup>[763]</sup></a> which seem to go back
in England to times before the conquest. A refrain, with
change of “summer” to “winter” in alternate stanzas, runs
through a ballad printed by Uhland:<a id='r764' /><a href='#f764' class='c012'><sup>[764]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c013'>Another refrain is sung “by all the youth,” when a mock
fight between the two is ended, and winter lies at jocund

hard to draw a line between the <i>volkspoesie</i> and the <i>volksthümliche</i>;

Böckel<a id='r768' /><a href='#f768' class='c012'><sup>[768]</sup></a> is right in looking on the winter and summer
songs as originally communal, with those dialogues between
soul and body, which one finds in nearly every literature of
Europe, as a learned and allegorical imitation; a combination
of the two kinds is not unusual.<a id='r769' /><a href='#f769' class='c012'><sup>[769]</sup></a> So one passes to all manner

but it is the old communal sap that keeps holly and ivy

<p class='c013'>Refrain and chorus of labour among savages have been
noted here and there in the foregoing pages; to collect them
to any extent would be useless. They are found everywhere,
and show that stage of development at which the repetition of
a single sentence, often of a single word, affords unmeasured
delight or ease. Individual singing is almost unknown in
many savage tribes,<a id='r773' /><a href='#f773' class='c012'><sup>[773]</sup></a> and the refrain in its function as deputy of
the older chorus, is less common than the chorus itself.<a id='r774' /><a href='#f774' class='c012'><sup>[774]</sup></a>
Where the savage is still mainly a hunter, mainly a warrior,
the refrain is insistent whenever a connected bit of description
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>breaks away from the choral song, as if artistic poetry
could not yet walk by itself; and where he has begun to till
the soil, or even merely to gather plants and fruits, there
is the chorus and there is the refrain of a rude harvest-home.
For the hunter and warrior we may quote Heckewelder’s
account.<a id='r775' /><a href='#f775' class='c012'><sup>[775]</sup></a> “Their songs are by no means inharmonious.
They sing in chorus; first the men and then the women.
At times the women join in the general song, or repeat the
strain which the men have just finished. It seems like two
parties singing in questions and answers, and is upon the
whole very agreeable and enlivening.... The singing
always begins by one person only, but others soon fall in
successively, until the general chorus begins, the drum beating
all the while to mark the time.” Their war-dance is
described in the familiar terms; but Heckewelder adds a
more interesting account of the feast which under agricultural
conditions would be a harvest-home. “After returning from
a successful expedition,” he says, “a dance of thanksgiving
is always performed.... It is accompanied with singing
and choruses, in which the women join.... At the end of
every song, the scalp-yell is shouted as many times as there
have been scalps taken from the enemy.” As to the rhythm,
Heckewelder makes a statement much clearer than the
accounts given in Schoolcraft’s question and answer, for
he does not undertake to express Indian metres in terms of
civilized poetry, but simply says that “their songs ... are
sung in short sentences, not without some kind of measure
harmonious to an Indian ear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>These Indians, however, were not in the absolutely primitive
stage, and the artist had elaborated dance, speech, song;
in short, like European peasants of isolated communities a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>century ago, the redskin was at that point of poetical development
where improvisation is a general gift, and every one
is expected to compose his bit of song, leaning, of course,
on the chorus, on refrain and repetition, and on those traditional
phrases which even more than modern speech realized
Schiller’s lines about the poet:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Weil dir ein Vers gelingt in einer gebildeten Sprache</div>
      <div class='line'>Die für dich dichtet und denkt, glaubst du schon</div>
      <div class='line'>Dichter zu sein?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“The Indians also meet,” says Heckewelder, “for the purpose
of recounting their warlike exploits, which is done in a
kind of half-singing or recitative ... the drum beating all
the while.... After each has made a short recital in his
turn, they begin again in the same order, and so continue
going the rounds, in a kind of alternate chaunting, until
every one has concluded.” It is easy to see that while the
chorus of war is an eminently communal performance, asking
an exactness of consent which makes strongly for rhythm
at its best, the conditions of nomadic and belligerent life must
breed excellent differences, set apart the great warrior, the
great orator, and work in certain ways toward communal disintegration
and the triumph of the artist. Agricultural communities,
on the other hand, foster the choral and social side
of poetry, and discourage individual feats. So even with the
Indians; witness that “cereal chorus,” as Schoolcraft calls
it,<a id='r776' /><a href='#f776' class='c012'><sup>[776]</sup></a> at the corn-husking, sung whenever a crooked ear is
found by one of the maidens:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Crooked ear, crooked ear, walker at night,—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>with additions and variations. This crooked ear, <i>wa-ge-min</i>,
is the symbol of a “thief in the cornfield,” and may have
some relationship with Mannhardt’s corn-demon.<a id='r777' /><a href='#f777' class='c012'><sup>[777]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>Older views of the American savage show him in the warlike
guise, to be sure, but with poetry overwhelmingly choral.
Lafitau,<a id='r778' /><a href='#f778' class='c012'><sup>[778]</sup></a> who says that commerce with the white man has
materially changed the savage’s customs, is determined to
paint him in his unspoiled state. During an eclipse, for
example, all the tribe dance in a peculiar manner, filling the
air with lugubrious cries; that rhythm is in them, though it
is no song in Lafitau’s ear, is proved by the dance, which, of
course, compels a rhythm, and by that picture of the girl
who shakes pebbles in a calabash, “trying meanwhile to
make her rough voice accord with this importunate jingle.”<a id='r779' /><a href='#f779' class='c012'><sup>[779]</sup></a>
Singing and dancing are the chief features of Indian social
life, and constitute the main charm of the life to come;
improvised songs, even speeches, occur, but general singing
and dancing make the background of their poetry and fill
their festivals.<a id='r780' /><a href='#f780' class='c012'><sup>[780]</sup></a> Everybody improvises, and has his special
song,—a trait noted among the Eskimo; the dancers always
sing, and apparently the singers always dance; the verse is
measured, but has no rime, and individual songs are always
supported by an accompanying <i>he! he!</i> in cadence from the
throng, a sort of burden. Dramatic songs of war are common;
and Lafitau gives a case marvellously like that Faroe
ballad of the luckless fisherman, with satirist and victim in full
view, although here the latter is passive, and is often forced
by the laughter and scorn of the tribe to break away and hide
his head in shame.<a id='r781' /><a href='#f781' class='c012'><sup>[781]</sup></a> Song-duels, too, as among the Eskimo,
are frequent, with throwing of ashes, which makes Lafitau
call on Athenæus for a parallel among the ancient Greeks.
But, after all, what sticks in Lafitau’s mind about Indian
dances is the fury of them and that wild <i>he! he!</i> which
gave them cadence, but which often “made the whole village
tremble and shake.” The war-dance is described in terms
familiar to the reader of later accounts.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Lery gives an older story, but in the same spirit as that
found in Lafitau. Of great interest is the Huguenot’s account<a id='r782' /><a href='#f782' class='c012'><sup>[782]</sup></a>
of a festivity which he and one Jacques Rousseau saw and heard
performed by five or six hundred savages in a certain village.
The men retired into one house, the women to another; Lery
and his friend were shut in with the women, about two hundred
in all. From the house of the men came a low murmur,
like that of folk at prayers; and the women, pricking their
ears, huddled together in great excitement. Then the noise
grew in volume, and the men could be heard singing in concert,
and often repeating their interjection, <i>he, he, he, he</i>; the
women now began to reply in kind, crying, <i>he, he, he, he</i>, for
more than a quarter-hour, leaping, meanwhile, and foaming
at the mouth, till it was quite plain to Lery that the devil was
entering into them. But this was not all. From another
house a mob of children now tuned the hallowed quire; and
the Huguenot, despite his year and a half in those parts, is
free to say he felt a desire to be “en nostre Fort,” doubting
the sequel of all this coil. Suddenly the women and children
were quiet; and Lery could now hear the men singing and
shouting “<i>d’un accord merveilleux</i>,” so that these “sweet
and more gracious sounds” heartened him to go near the
house of the men. He made a hole in the soft wall and
looked in; then, with two friends, he went inside, saw the
dance, and heard the songs, which ran on without stop.
All the men stood in a close circle, but without clasping
hands or stirring from the place, bent forward, moving
only the leg and the right foot, each having his right
hand on his buttocks, the arm and left hand hanging,
and so danced and sang. It seems to have been a communal
dance, like that of the Botocudos, save that certain
priests—<i>caraïbes</i>—richly arrayed, holding in their hands
“little rattles or bells made of a fruit bigger than an ostrich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>egg,” had evidently extraordinary powers. There is a remarkable
picture by way of illustration,<a id='r783' /><a href='#f783' class='c012'><sup>[783]</sup></a> showing the naked
dancer, bent over, as described, with a priest behind him,
a parrot on a perch just above the dancer’s shoulder, and a
monkey at his feet,—these doubtless an exuberance of the
artist.</p>

<p class='c013'>The social foundation, the communal dance, the incessant
refrain, the festal excitement, are here plain outcome of
primitive conditions in survival; the priest, and the ritual functions
which are left to one’s guessing, show that mingling of
ceremonial tradition and art which is bound to spring up with
even savage culture. Despite this mingling, however, the overwhelming
characteristic of the whole affair is communal, and
the songs are in close tether to the refrain. An excellent summary
of American savage songs and American savage poetry in
general has been already quoted in part from a paper by Dr.
Brinton,<a id='r784' /><a href='#f784' class='c012'><sup>[784]</sup></a> and may be used here as a conclusion of the whole
matter. Repetition is the groundwork of this poetry; it is
always sung; it has no rhythm,—no metre, that is,—no
alliteration, but depends on two kinds of repetition. Either
one verse is repeated indefinitely, or a refrain is used. “The
refrain is usually interjectional and wholly meaningless; and
the verses are often repeated without alteration four or five
times ever.” This is the case with Eskimo poetry. Now and
then, each line “is followed by an interjectional burden.” A
little ballad may be quoted from Dr. Brinton’s paper<a id='r785' /><a href='#f785' class='c012'><sup>[785]</sup></a> to show
how events passed into poetry, without forming what could be
called in any sense narrative or epic verse. About the year
1820, the Pawnees captured a girl and put her to the torture;
but a Pawnee brave, of generous vein, made a daring rescue and
flight. After three days he came back; and as the thing
was so mad, it was counted inspiration, and no one harmed
him. Whereupon this song was sung:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Well he foretold this,</div>
      <div class='line'>Well he foretold this,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yes, he foretold this,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I, Pitale-Sharu,<a id='r786' /><a href='#f786' class='c012'><sup>[786]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>Am arrived here.</div>
      <div class='line'>Well he foretold this,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yes, he foretold this;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I, Pitale-Sharu,<a href='#f786' class='c012'><sup>[786]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>Am arrived here,—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and in this song, leaning so hard on the event, so bare of
statement, so woven in with the life of the actual day that
lapse even of a year or so must have brought need to its
hearers to be edified by the margent,<a id='r787' /><a href='#f787' class='c012'><sup>[787]</sup></a> so dependent on the
refrain, so suggestive of an accompanying dance and of
gestures to make the little drama real, it is not unfair to say
that one has at least some of those factors which went to
make the beginnings of poetry.</p>

<p class='c013'>The refrain has been considered as the main communal
element in songs of labour; here are its functions in communal
play, primarily a combination of consenting cries and
movements in the festal dance. The song that always went
with a dance got its name thence, and was called a ballad;
and in the ballad, whether strictly taken as a narrative song,
or as the purely lyrical outburst for which there is no better
term than folksong, this consenting and cadenced series of
words found its main refuge and record. The subject is
complicated enough, and asks a volume to put it into any
semblance of order; all that can be done here is to group the
main facts in their relation to primitive poetry. Unless one
holds fast to the idea that refrains represent the original
choral song of the mass, one begins to explain them by their
modern features, and thus, while accurate as to a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>stage of poetry, falls into error on the historic and genetic
side. Ferdinand Wolf<a id='r788' /><a href='#f788' class='c012'><sup>[788]</sup></a> gives an admirable account of the
refrain, an admirable definition, but with a wrong inference
of origins, when he assigns it to the participation of the people
or of the congregation in songs which were sung to them by
one or more persons on festal occasions, where the throng
repeated in chorus single words, verses, whole strophes, or
else in pauses of the main song answered the singer with
a repeated shout to express their agreement, applause, horror,
joy, or grief,—a shout which often lost its real meaning and
became a mere conventional choral cry. Hence, says Wolf,
it is clear that the refrain is as old as songs of the people.<a id='r789' /><a href='#f789' class='c012'><sup>[789]</sup></a> It
has been said that this statement is misleading in any genetic
sense; it fails to note the growth of the exarch or foresinger
into the poet, and to follow the backward curve of evolution
to a point where the voice of the foresinger is lost in the
voices of the choral throng itself, that raw material from which
all poetry has been made. On the other hand, this definition
undoubtedly states the facts of the refrain in its mediæval
stage of survival from the chorus. In ballads, for example,
it is the part taken by the throng in distinction from the part
of the minstrel; but there is great difficulty in deciding how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>the throng actually sang the refrain. Names are no guide;
and the terms, chorus, refrain, and burden are used in no
exclusive fashion.<a id='r790' /><a href='#f790' class='c012'><sup>[790]</sup></a> Probably one will not stray far from facts
if one assumes that whenever a ballad came to be sung artistically,
as a part-song in the rough, the refrain—<i>hey-no-nonny,
the wind and the rain</i>, or what not—was really a
burden, “the base, foot, or under-song”;<a id='r791' /><a href='#f791' class='c012'><sup>[791]</sup></a> as is proved by the
scene in <i>Much Ado</i>,<a id='r792' /><a href='#f792' class='c012'><sup>[792]</sup></a> where no man is in the group to sing
this base or foot, and Margaret, wishing a song to which they
can dance, cries,—“Clap us into <i>Light o’ Love</i>; that goes
without a burden: do you sing it, and I’ll dance it.” A passage
quoted by many writers from the old play, <i>The Longer
thou Livest the more Foole thou art</i>, tells how Moros enters,
“synging the foote of many songes”; and bits of them follow,
an interesting list; a little later, three of the characters are
to “beare the foote,” and there is much testing of the key.
On the other hand, in Jonson’s <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>,<a id='r793' /><a href='#f793' class='c012'><sup>[793]</sup></a> there is
the same play of getting key and tune, and Cokes “sings
the burden” with Nightingale; but this is simply a couplet
recurring at the end of each stanza. So Guest<a id='r794' /><a href='#f794' class='c012'><sup>[794]</sup></a> defines the
burden as “the return of the same words at the close of each
stave.” Is this right? For what one most wishes to know,
so far as the singing of ballads is concerned, is whether the
refrain, constant or intermittent, was sung as the “foot,” that
is, contemporaneously with the regular lines, or after them,
either as couplet or in alternation,—as in—<a id='r795' /><a href='#f795' class='c012'><sup>[795]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Here the fitness of things indicates intermittent singing of
the refrain which thus makes a four-line stanza out of a two-line
stanza; this is Rosenberg’s theory of the evolution of a
ballad strophe.<a id='r796' /><a href='#f796' class='c012'><sup>[796]</sup></a> Certainly the refrain came to be used in
artistic and late communal poetry to mark off the stanza as
the rime marked off the verse. What we now call a chorus,
a recurrent stanza, sung after each new stanza, is often a
clear case in ballads; for example, in <i>The Twa Magicians</i>,<a id='r797' /><a href='#f797' class='c012'><sup>[797]</sup></a>
that provocative and tuneful cadence of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

      <div class='line in2'>For a’ your muckle pride.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But there is doubt in regard to the refrain when it is said to
be sung as burden, or what Grundtvig calls burden-stem;
although there is no doubt that refrains were taken from
folksong and chorus and were used as burdens in the ballad.<a id='r798' /><a href='#f798' class='c012'><sup>[798]</sup></a>
Even the song of labour is used for the refrain:<a id='r799' /><a href='#f799' class='c012'><sup>[799]</sup></a>—</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The question, as Professor Child acknowledged, is extraordinarily
difficult even when narrowed down to ballads. It
is discussed at length in an unpublished dissertation by the
late Dr. J. H. Boynton, who decides for the simultaneous
singing of the ballad strophe and the refrain,<a id='r800' /><a href='#f800' class='c012'><sup>[800]</sup></a> and incidentally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>for the growth of a four-line strophe out of the early
strophe of two lines. Icelandic and Faroe ballads show the
most archaic elements in the Germanic group, and “a large
proportion of their refrains deal directly with the dance.”
The “stem” is sung first by the leader of the dance, and is a
“lyric in itself,” fit to go “with any ballad.” Now it is clear
that whether the ballad and the burden were sung simultaneously,
as Boynton believes to have been the case, or alternately,
as certain English ballads seem to require, and as
Guest assumed in his definition, this question of musical
technique cannot affect the inference that the burden, a
“lyric in itself” which serves as refrain, is older than the
ballad or narrative song, and has most intimate relations with
the steps of the dance. In other words, here is the refrain in
its passage from a dominant place as choral repetition of the
throng, timed to their steps and deriving its existence from
these steps and from the expression of festal delight that
prompted them, to an ancillary and subordinate place as choral
support to the artistic progress of a narrative in song.
This agrees with the records of communal song not only
under savage conditions but among the homogeneous and
unlettered communities of Europe. Neocorus,<a id='r801' /><a href='#f801' class='c012'><sup>[801]</sup></a> a priest who
writes about the beginning of the seventeenth century, defending
that unschooled song which he still heard at the
dances and festivities of his countryfolk of the Cimbrian
peninsula, and which still flowed so easily, although much of
it was lost that ought to have been recorded and sung, describes
their communal dance; it is in a fairly advanced
stage, of course, and is led by an expert. First, this leader
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>comes forward singing alone, or with a colleague, and begins
a ballad. “And when he has sung a verse, he sings no further,
but the whole throng, who either know the ballad or
else have paid close attention to him, repeat and echo the
same verse. And when they have brought it to the point
where the leader stopped, he begins again and sings another
verse.” This is again repeated. Presently, with the singing
thus under way, a leader of the dance comes forward, hat in
hand, dances about the room, and invites the whole assembly
to join. Facts which have been given already, and facts
still to be considered, show clearly that these leaders of song
and of dance are deputies of the throng which once danced
as a mass to its own choral singing. On the other hand, as
Boynton noted, repetition and refrain may take the form of a
genuine burden. In Icelandic ballads, the “burden-stem”
was often in a different metre from the ballad stanza; it was
sung “to support the voice by harmonious notes under the
melody,” and “was heard separately only when the voices singing
the air stopped.”<a id='r802' /><a href='#f802' class='c012'><sup>[802]</sup></a> But in the Faroe isles “the whole
stem is sung first, and then repeated as a burden at the end
of every verse.” This is certainly more natural than the process,
known in Iceland, where a leader sings the incremental
stanzas and the throng keeps singing the burden or accompaniment;
although a very familiar ballad might so be sung,
and the fact would of course indicate either a shifting of interest
toward purely musical ends, as in Elizabethan England,
or else a devotion on the part of the crowd to the dance
proper and the refrain, while the narrative is left to the leader
of the song.<a id='r803' /><a href='#f803' class='c012'><sup>[803]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Apart from the manner of singing it under later conditions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>the refrain in itself, so far as ballads are concerned, is clearly
the recurrent verse or verses sung by the festal crowd; and the
nearer one comes to the source of a ballad, that is, to the
dancing throng, the more insistent and pervasive and dominant
this refrain becomes. That is the fact which nobody
has ever denied. Jeanroy,<a id='r804' /><a href='#f804' class='c012'><sup>[804]</sup></a> in a careful discussion of origins,
concludes that refrains are really fragments of song for the
dance, now and then, as he hints, of songs of labour; he
regards them solely in their function as lines sung at the end
of a stanza, and like other scholars thinks they were “originally
repeated by the chorus in answer to the soloist.”<a id='r805' /><a href='#f805' class='c012'><sup>[805]</sup></a> Elsewhere,
however, he grants that this need not have been the
universal fashion, and that now and then all the dancers may
have sung all the song,<a id='r806' /><a href='#f806' class='c012'><sup>[806]</sup></a> a theory fortified by his conjecture
that the refrain was once made up of imitative sounds. However,
the modern refrain of the dance, best preserved among
French and Italians, is a lively lilting couplet, or the like, to
which the other riming verses are prefixed in the growth of
the actual song, as in the stanzas quoted from Bujeaud:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Là haut, dessus ces rochettes,</div>
      <div class='line'>J’entend le haut-bois jouer,</div>
      <div class='line'>Et vous autr’, jeunes fillettes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Qui allez au bal danser,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Allez, allez, tenez vous dreites,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Prenez gard’ de n’ pas tomber</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>The transition is very evident. In another case<a id='r807' /><a href='#f807' class='c012'><sup>[807]</sup></a> the leader
calls on the dancers to make some cry imitative of animals,
which now serves as refrain; but, wherever found, the test
of a really popular refrain, as Jeanroy insists, is that it was
made for the dance. Read “in the dance,” and communal
conditions are even better satisfied.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the ballad is a song made in the dance, and so by the
dance; a mass of those older dance-songs which have come
down to us as popular, are later development, are of either
aristocratic or learned origin, and simply point back to the
communal dance which is the real source of the song.
Originally a chorus of all the dancers, it gave vent to the
feelings of joy,—in the old <i>vocero</i> dance, of grief,—to the
common emotion of the throng. An impulse which makes
for this song of the dance is simple delight that the season of
dancing is begun:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A l’entrada del tems clar, <i>eya</i>;<a id='r808' /><a href='#f808' class='c012'><sup>[808]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and so one may trace these invocations of nature to their later
form at the beginning of a narrative song like <i>Robin Hood
and the Monk</i>. This dancing of the round as an expression
of feeling on the part of a throng—dancing in pairs, we
know, did not reach Neocorus’s country, for example, until
the middle of the sixteenth century—meets one everywhere
in mediæval records, and it has died a reluctant death;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>unless observation be at fault, even children are ceasing to
play the old round games common not many years ago, a
city of refuge that seemed at one time so secure. But in
those mediæval days one danced in throngs on almost any
occasion; and impossible as the story may be if taken
literally, there is truth enough for our purpose in that
account<a id='r809' /><a href='#f809' class='c012'><sup>[809]</sup></a> of Leicester’s army in 1173 pausing on a heath,
where they “fell to daunce and singe—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hoppe, Wylikin, hoppe Wyllikin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ingland is thine and mine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Many of the folksongs go little beyond this stage of an
exhortation to dance, along with a brief comment on the
posture of affairs or on the scene. Such an exhortation as
refrain for the dance occurs in the old play of the <i>Four
Elements</i>, with an interesting context. Says Ignorance—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I can you thank; that is done well;</div>
      <div class='line'>It is pity ye had not a minstrel</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For to augment your solace.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and Sensual Desire replies:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As for minstrel, it maketh no force,<a id='r810' /><a href='#f810' class='c012'><sup>[810]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>Ye shall see me dance a course</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Without a minstrel.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Then he singeth this song and danceth withal, and evermore
maketh countenance according to the matter; and all the
others answer likewise:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Dance we, dance we, prance we, prance we.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Ignorance says it “is the best dance without a pipe he has
seen this seven year.” But Humanity inclines to think “a
kit or taboret” would improve the dance; and the dancers
retire to a tavern where they are sure “of one or twain of
minstrels that can well play.” Humanity now proposes “to
sing some lusty ballad”; but Ignorance is against all such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>“peevish prick-ear’d song,” and when he is told that prick-song
in church pleases God, makes the often-quoted reply
that there is no good reason why it is “not as good to say
plainly <i>Give me a spade</i>, as <i>Give me a spa, ve, va, ve, va,
vade</i>.” No; if a song is wanted, one of the good old sort
will do; and there follows a list not unlike that of Moros in
the play or that of Laneham in the letter, with the trifling
exception that this runs into a helpless sort of burlesque.
“Robin Hood in Barnsdale stood” is probably a genuine
first line, and so are some of the other titles. The main
thing is that ballad singing is opposed to prick-song and the
new fashions generally, and that a refrain from all lusty
throats is better for the dance than pipe or minstrel. The
refrain in this case is just the old exhortation to dance. This
exhortation is common enough in folksong, alone or as a
refrain:<a id='r811' /><a href='#f811' class='c012'><sup>[811]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Springe wir den reigen ...</div>
      <div class='line'>Saute, blonde, ma joli’ blonde ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>but a pure and simple description of the matter in hand, as
communal, spontaneous, and immediate an expression in song
as may be, and tied to steps of the dance by the shortest
of tethers, is doubtless to be found in the game where a
circle of children dance round one of their companions in
the ring to this refrain:<a id='r812' /><a href='#f812' class='c012'><sup>[812]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>Here we go the jingo-ring,</div>
      <div class='line'>The jingo-ring, the jingo-ring,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here we go the jingo-ring</div>
      <div class='line'>About the merry-ma-tanzie.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Let this be a survival of a wedding ceremony, or whatever
the learned will, the refrain, sung with each stanza, and
suited of course to the action, is typical of the earliest choral
stage.<a id='r813' /><a href='#f813' class='c012'><sup>[813]</sup></a> Now so soon as narrative takes the place of this
description of contemporary and common action, this exhortation
of all to all to do something which they are all doing, then
memory, deliberation, arrangement, are needed, and an artist
comes to the fore. When a ballad records some doing of
the folk, when the epic element takes upper hand, it is clear
that a process of separation is inevitable. A ballad of this
sort may long remain as favourite song for the communal
dance. Thus a lively little thing, found in Flanders and in
Germany,<a id='r814' /><a href='#f814' class='c012'><sup>[814]</sup></a> is of particular interest, first for the narrative
which is the old satire on monk and nun, so popular in
mediæval times; secondly for the refrain, which is nothing
less than a dance about the maypole, keeping the song itself
in some places for this festivity; and thirdly for the wandering
of the ballad as a whole, from the fifteenth century
down to its modern refuge in a children’s game:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A monk went walking along the strand,—</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Hey! ’twas in the May!</div>
      <div class='line'>He took his sweetheart<a id='r815' /><a href='#f815' class='c012'><sup>[815]</sup></a> by the hand,—</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Hey! ’twas in the May!</div>
      <div class='line in12'>So gay!</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Hey! ’twas in the May!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>Here the dance has held its own with the story; but in most
cases, as the foresinger or exarch takes command, the new
verses, beginning as incremental repetition in the dance,
grow bolder and learn to walk alone; singing is still a condition,
but the dance is only an occasion, not a cause; and
finally the crowd passes over the bridge of chorus and refrain
into a quite passive state of audience, with intermittent echo
and applause, utterly disappearing at last behind the sheets
of a broadside.</p>

<p class='c013'>This, of course, is a conclusion at very long range; and
there is an extensive period, a large field, where elements of
art mingled freely with the old communal motive. For a
single example, take the <i>Bouquet de Marjolaine</i>.<a id='r816' /><a href='#f816' class='c012'><sup>[816]</sup></a> This is a
case of incremental repetition, with the same rimes throughout,
and an unvaried refrain or chorus which is knitted to
each stanza by this pervading rime. The third line of each
stanza forms the opening line of the next stanza, so that the
story proceeds slowly but surely to the end. The whole can
be gathered from one stanza and its refrain, with addition
of the following incremental lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Me promenant dans la plaine,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>(Tir’ ton joli bas de laine)</div>
      <div class='line'>J’ai trouvé un Capitaine.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>(Tir’ ton, tir’ ton, tir’ ton bas,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tir’ ton joli bas de laine,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Car on le verra.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Then, “il m’a appelé’ vilaine”; “je ne suis point si vilaine;”
“le plus jeun’ fils du roi m’aime;” “il m’a donné pour
étrenne”—“une bourse d’écus pleine,” “un bouquet de
marjolaine;” “je l’ai planté dans la plaine;”—and, for good
last, and with that touch of pathos common in these things,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>despite the gay tone, “s’il fleurit, je serai reine”; and so,
with the refrain, an end. Full of communal elements, this
song is nevertheless of an artistic type and of an aristocratic
origin, an offshot of the <i>pastourelle</i> and its kin; popular
enough, of a certain simplicity and beauty, it is not directly
communal in its tone; it has gone among the people, and
yet, though it was imitated from purely communal refrains,
like other and older songs treated so successfully by Jeanroy,
it has not come directly from the people. In fact, the communal
refrain of the dance is seldom in such independent
case as this infectious lilt; when it is not a survival, as in
children’s games, its best chance for life is as parasite to a
narrative ballad or even to a “lyric of sentiment and reflection,”
as anthologies call them. Thus Ten Brink is undoubtedly
right when he takes the refrain as old, traditional,
communal, and the stanzas as new and artistic, in that pretty
English lyric, <i>Ichot a burde in boure bryht</i>, which has the
refrain at the beginning, as in many Provençal ballads:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Blow, northern wind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Send thou me my sweeting!</div>
      <div class='line'>Blow, northern wind, blow, blow, blow!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Compare this with the artistic refrain of <i>Alisoun</i>, from which
it differs so widely, and with the refrain of the Cuckoo Song,
in its recorded form part of an elaborate composition, but
doubtless taken from the “nature” refrain of a dance. The
ballads and folksongs of Europe are of course in the transitional
stage. They ought to be sung, but many of them may
have been recited; they echo the cadence of a dancing
throng, and have often timed the dance, though they are
separable from such company. It must be borne in mind,
however, that many ballads in which one would not now suspect
such uses, were employed to regulate the slow steps of a
dance. Narrative ballads were in great favour for the purpose;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Faroe islanders danced to the stories of Sigurd, and
the Russians, whose folksongs are always choral and without
instrumental music, dance the <i>khorovod</i> to a narrative song,—in
fact, the word means a blended song and dance; while
even the Robin Hood ballads, if we may believe the <i>Complaynt
of Scotland</i>, as well as some ballad of Johnny Armstrong,
were sung at the dance of the shepherds. Savages sing
narrative poems to the dance, and so do Melanesians.<a id='r817' /><a href='#f817' class='c012'><sup>[817]</sup></a> One
can therefore understand the statement made by Steenstrup,<a id='r818' /><a href='#f818' class='c012'><sup>[818]</sup></a>
that every genuine ballad has a refrain, though this may not
be recorded; for the refrain is the tie which binds a ballad
to its parent dance. As one retraces the path of the ballad,
the refrain grows in importance, slowly pushing the leader or
soloist nearer and nearer to the throng, until he is lost in it;
and a repetition of cadenced choral cries becomes the main
factor of poetry. As every one knows, those cadenced cries
were regulated by the dance; and to this important factor
in early poetry, already considered under the head of rhythm,
we must now turn.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dancing, most momentary of all the arts, as A. W. Schlegel
called it, in Wagner’s words “the most real,” seeing that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>whole man is concerned in it, “from head to foot,” with motions
and gestures that give it tone, and rhythm that gives it
speech,<a id='r819' /><a href='#f819' class='c012'><sup>[819]</sup></a> was also the primitive and universal art, the sign of
social consent; consenting steps, with mimicry of whatever
sort, timed a series of rude cries which expressed the emotion
of the moment, and so grew into articulate language. But
the song detached itself from dancing long before dancing
could shake off the choral cries and the refrain. Among
Tasmanians and Australians songs already existed apart from
the dance; but there was no dance without a song, and the
dances were prevailingly of the whole horde or clan. Survivals
of this primitive stage, and the early history of dancing in all
quarters of the world, afford good warrant for the conclusion
of Böhme;<a id='r820' /><a href='#f820' class='c012'><sup>[820]</sup></a> “no dance without singing, and no song without
a dance,” is his axiom for earliest times. Moreover, this
proof of the connection of song and dance in the primitive
horde, a bond which one or two writers have lately tried to
sever, but without success, disposes of Mr. Herbert Spencer’s
attempt<a id='r821' /><a href='#f821' class='c012'><sup>[821]</sup></a> to explain the dance as a modification of the old
movement of obeisance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dancing is universal among savages; and if a few cases
occur which make against this doctrine, one may safely assume,
as Ribot does, and even Wallaschek,<a id='r822' /><a href='#f822' class='c012'><sup>[822]</sup></a> that they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>due to insufficient observation,<a id='r823' /><a href='#f823' class='c012'><sup>[823]</sup></a> or else, at the worst, that
they belong to tribes with hardly any claims of humanity,
degenerates, retrogrades, who have no social order and consequently
no dance. Again, the primitive form of the dance
is to be found in the choral throng; but it must be borne in
mind that even rudest tribes can develop an art of complicated,
traditional, and ritual character,<a id='r824' /><a href='#f824' class='c012'><sup>[824]</sup></a> which in its turn
breeds the solo and the professional artist in dancing. However,
the choral dies hard even under civilized conditions;
among savages it is prominent everywhere and in full vigour.
Waitz,<a id='r825' /><a href='#f825' class='c012'><sup>[825]</sup></a> speaking of tribes in the South Seas, says that song
there is mainly choral, and dancing, affair of the community
as a whole, is as universal as song, often passing into mimicry
and a rude drama. Everywhere, too, song is accompanied by
dancing, and when women thus dance and sing they clap
hands or slap the hip in time with their steps and words,
after the manner of their sisters in mediæval Europe. Musical
instruments are few. Chamisso noted now and then
what he took to be degeneration of song into mere howling;
but we know there is a more excellent way to explain these
festal and cadenced cries. Dancing is in order at each
important moment for the community,—when strangers
arrive, when war is imminent, at feasts of every sort. As
with these natives of the South Sea, so with other and more
savage tribes. It is useless to insist in detail upon the
African love of dancing, which goes on every evening and in
every village for hours at a time. “The natives of Obbo
began their dance by all singing together a wild but pleasant-sounding
melody in chorus,<a id='r826' /><a href='#f826' class='c012'><sup>[826]</sup></a>” is only one of many descriptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>of this favourite communal diversion; but the legends
and the complicated artistic dances which exist side by side
with the choral song and the communal dance warn one that
while primitive ways survive on the Dark Continent, there is
a lower stage of song and dance to be found elsewhere. Like
the Botocudos in South America, the Australians are on a
quite elementary level with regard to dance and song; they
attach more importance to the gesture than to the articulate
word, so far as the telling of stories or the describing of
events is concerned, and they know scarcely any individual
performance.<a id='r827' /><a href='#f827' class='c012'><sup>[827]</sup></a> Dance and song are of the horde, the clan,
as a whole. Choral shouts, refrains which repeat a word or
a short phrase indefinitely, and so time the steps of the
throng, make the original social art; with the aid of gesture,
mimicry of labour, of feats of hunting, this passes into
kangaroo-dances, erotic pantomimes, sham fights, and all the
rest. Perhaps, as Hirn<a id='r828' /><a href='#f828' class='c012'><sup>[828]</sup></a> suggests, the dance of the Weddas,
or Veddahs, in Ceylon is as primitive as anything of the kind;
although Ehrenreich’s account of the Botocudos<a id='r829' /><a href='#f829' class='c012'><sup>[829]</sup></a> shows little
if any advance. A spear is stuck into the ground to serve as
centre for the ring of dancers, who move with swaying of legs
and arms to the cadence of their own singing,—call it rather
shouting,—while they keep exact time by slapping the naked
stomach.<a id='r830' /><a href='#f830' class='c012'><sup>[830]</sup></a> From this communal dance and song, emerges
after a while, as in the case of the Botocudos, an individual
performer; and it is clear that elaborate dances, such as those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>given for the benefit of Captain Cook and other foreign
visitors, are an outgrowth of this primitive huddling in mass
with concert of cries and movements. It is significant that
instinct of the clan calls for some concerted dance and song
as necessary preface for war or any similar doing of the
community as a whole; in long range of development this
is the war-dance of our own Indians, often described, where
a general chorus serves as background and stimulus alike to
the volunteers who step forward singly and promise, in
chanted and improvised song that times their steps, deeds of
individual valour in the impending fight. So, perhaps, the
<i>gab</i> of romance, the <i>gilp</i> or <i>gilpewide</i><a id='r831' /><a href='#f831' class='c012'><sup>[831]</sup></a> of Germanic warriors,
was originally made not only, as we know it, in the mead hall,
but to the chorus of the tribes and with the steps of a dance.
At close range, however, and with the foe in sight, it was a
communal and general gab, a choral performance; witness
the interesting account of Captain Cook.<a id='r832' /><a href='#f832' class='c012'><sup>[832]</sup></a> In the first voyage,
some four hundred islanders, about to attack the captain
and his friends, but hesitating, at length “sung the song of
defiance and began to dance.” Such was a particular case;
and in his general statement, Cook says that New Zealanders,
before they begin the onset, “join in a war-song, to which
they all keep the exactest time”; and while he does not mention
the dance here, it is evidently implied, for his scattered
accounts of skirmish and fight are full of it. A curious case
is what would seem to be a war-dance in a boat which was
attacking Cook’s ship; as it approached, the savages in the
boat varied menaces with peaceful talk, “till, imagining the
sailors were afraid of them, they began the war-song and
dance, and threw stones on board the ship.” Then Cook
goes on: “In the war-dance their motions are numerous,
their limbs are distorted ... they shake their darts, brandish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>their spears ... they accompany this dance with a song,
which is sung in concert; every strain ending with a loud
and deep sigh. There is an activity and vigour in their
dancing which is truly admirable; and their idea of keeping
time is such that sixty or eighty paddles will strike at once
against the sides of their boats, and make only one report.”
Concerted singing, this communal initiative, goes not only
before war, but before embassies, messages of peace, greetings,
and the like; and the dance is clearly an original prop
of this song, now and then retained, but often omitted. In
Cook’s last voyage,<a id='r833' /><a href='#f833' class='c012'><sup>[833]</sup></a> “a double canoe, in which were twelve
men, came towards us. As they drew near the ship, they
recited some words in concert, by way of chorus, one of the
number first standing up and giving the word before each
repetition,”—a “solemn chant,” Cook calls it. Readers of
these and other voyages in the South Seas, know how singing
rather than speaking takes the foreground of private as
well as of tribal life; a chief coming on board the ship hails
it with a song to explain his visit, and there is the case of the
islander who told in song his story of life aboard an English
ship, and, asking the native who had met him what news
there was from home, put his excited questions in rhythm
and got the equally excited answers in rapid chant. Behind
this individual song is the chorus; with the chorus is nearly
always the dance; wherever the dance, there is song. Musical
instruments the islanders knew, of course,—drums, perhaps,
best; but as Cook says<a id='r834' /><a href='#f834' class='c012'><sup>[834]</sup></a> of a great dance which was
given for him, it did not seem “that the dancers were much
assisted by these sounds, <i>but by a chorus of vocal music, in
which all the performers joined at the same time</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Indians of the Western continent have the same tale to tell,
and it has been told in part already by Lery, Lafitau, and the
older travellers. A century and more ago, Carver<a id='r835' /><a href='#f835' class='c012'><sup>[835]</sup></a> noted
that the savages of North America “usually dance either
before or after every meal”;<a id='r836' /><a href='#f836' class='c012'><sup>[836]</sup></a> and “they never meet on any
public occasion, but this makes a part of the entertainment....
The youth of both sexes amuse themselves in this
manner every evening.” At the feasts and other dances,
“every man rises in his turn, and moves about with great
freedom and boldness, singing, as he does so, the exploits of
his ancestors. During this the company, who are seated on
the ground in a circle, join with him in making the cadence,
by an odd tone, which they utter all together, and which
sounds ‘<i>Heh, heh, heh</i>.’” This they repeat “with the same
violence during the whole of the entertainment.” “The
women dance without taking any steps ... but with their
feet conjoined, moving by turns their toes and heels.... Let
those who join in the dance be ever so numerous, they keep
time so exactly with each other that no interruption ensues.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In recent times the intricate dances, ritual and ceremony
which, of course, reach back in far tradition, have been
studied and recorded; but this is not a primitive phase of
the art,<a id='r837' /><a href='#f837' class='c012'><sup>[837]</sup></a> and even among the Moqui and Navajo tribes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>New Mexico, where instrumental music is common, now and
then the dancers furnish their own music, each one rolling
out “an <i>aw, aw, aw, aw</i>, in a deep bass tone.”<a id='r838' /><a href='#f838' class='c012'><sup>[838]</sup></a> So in ancient
Mexico, where civilization of a sort had long held sway, the
dances “were almost always accompanied by singing”; this,
however, was “adjusted by the beating of instruments.”<a id='r839' /><a href='#f839' class='c012'><sup>[839]</sup></a>
But this public dance is no longer communal in the old way;
ritual of the clan becomes a state religion, while dance and
song are not only lifted but expanded. There is a sense of
ritual, to be sure, about the dance of a small community, as
when among the Bechuanas, to ask a man “what he dances,”
is the same as asking to what clan or tribe he belongs, a
phrase curiously akin to Gosson’s remark<a id='r840' /><a href='#f840' class='c012'><sup>[840]</sup></a> that “to daunce
the same round” means to be of the same flock. But all this
belongs only to the primitive horde or the late homogeneous
community; the dance of such a little clan about their growing
crops yielded to traditional and solemn rites, and the spontaneous
singing and dancing which Vergil recommends to his
farmers<a id='r841' /><a href='#f841' class='c012'><sup>[841]</sup></a> is really a more primitive stage of the art than the
seemingly older ceremony of the Arval brothers, which had
already hardened into ritual and belonged to a close corporation
under control of the state. Tribal dances become expiatory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>and religious acts at a very early stage of culture; it is
easy to see that the records would preserve such a dance
only when it had lost some of its spontaneous character, and
taken on a ritual form. Germanic, Slavic, and Romance peoples
have the communal dance surviving as a religious act;
and it was one of the hardest tasks for councils and bishops
to stop this dancing of the congregation within the church
itself. Often they allowed it in a modified form. As a part
of ritual, choristers still dance before the altar of the cathedral
at Seville; sixteen boys in blue and white form “in two
eights,” facing each other, and the priests kneel in a semi-circle
round them. Then “an unseen orchestra” begins to
play, the boys put on their hats and sing the <i>coplas</i> in honour
of the Virgin:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O mi, O mi amada</div>
      <div class='line'>Immaculada!—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“to a dance measure.” After this they begin to dance, “still
singing,” a “kind of solemn minuet.”<a id='r842' /><a href='#f842' class='c012'><sup>[842]</sup></a> This is done at the
feast of the Immaculate Conception. In the sixteenth century
boys and girls danced about an image of Christ set upon
the altar of German churches, singing Christmas songs, while
their parents stood by, also singing and clapping their hands
in time with the dance.<a id='r843' /><a href='#f843' class='c012'><sup>[843]</sup></a> From these good folk to the German
barbarians “running in a circle” round the goat’s head
and “singing diabolical songs,” as seen and heard by Gregory,<a id='r844' /><a href='#f844' class='c012'><sup>[844]</sup></a>
is no long step backward in development if it is in
chronology. When the children were at last driven from the
churches, and when the old ring-dance was at last forgotten
by their elders, even in the fields and about the fires of St.
John’s Eve, the little ones made a brave rescue and kept up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>the ritual in their games. Now even these are vanishing.
Outside of Europe, sacred and even national dances of the
throng go this same path of development and decline. The
Hebrew communal dance passed into traditional forms;<a id='r845' /><a href='#f845' class='c012'><sup>[845]</sup></a>
and there are other dances, outside of religious cult, which
acquire a fixed form and are passed down as of tribal and
even national significance. One thinks of the Pyrrhic dance;<a id='r846' /><a href='#f846' class='c012'><sup>[846]</sup></a>
indeed, a study of the sword-dance in all its varieties, and
from this double point of view, communal and national,
would be of great interest. Savages, as Donovan remarked,
imitate in their dancing now the movement of animals, now
the clash of arms in war, and again, though not to the extent
asserted by Scherer, erotic gestures.<a id='r847' /><a href='#f847' class='c012'><sup>[847]</sup></a> For the second sort,
a gymnastic motive, the sense of preparation and drill for
future fighting, and a festal or reminiscential motive, combine
to produce such an exercise as the sword-dance, a convenient
name for this group, although the sword itself is not always
in evidence. Chronology is here of no account; for earliest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>records may show a well-defined and almost national exercise
such as Tacitus noted among the Germans, and very late
examples can be found of the purely communal sword-dance,
with flyting, songs, refrain, and rustic acting, as in the
Revesby Sword Play;<a id='r848' /><a href='#f848' class='c012'><sup>[848]</sup></a> while Xenophon tells of a little
drama, enacted by soldiers of the ten thousand, combining
the weapon dance, the imitated fight, and other elements, in
terms which could be matched by many an account given by
traveller or missionary of a similar affair among quite savage
tribes.<a id='r849' /><a href='#f849' class='c012'><sup>[849]</sup></a> It is easy to see how one of the many paths
from this dance of mimicry, exercise, and rhythmic shouting,
would lead to the narrative song or ballad, and how such a
ballad would long cleave to a particular traditional dance.
The Phæacians have a narrative song sung to them as they
are dancing, and when two dance alone, tossing the ball,<a id='r850' /><a href='#f850' class='c012'><sup>[850]</sup></a> “the
other youths ... beat time”; but an older and more communal
habit is found in the dances of the Faroe islanders,
where the gestures and expression of face show how keenly
the folk feel what they sing;<a id='r851' /><a href='#f851' class='c012'><sup>[851]</sup></a> in the Icelandic <i>rimur</i>, narrative
songs which went with the dance; on the Cimbrian peninsula,
where ballads about the battle of Hemmingstede were used
for the same purpose; in scattered rural communities<a id='r852' /><a href='#f852' class='c012'><sup>[852]</sup></a> of
Europe; and among savage tribes the world over. It has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>been made clear to probation how the narrative ballad grew
out of a tribal or communal dance; and it is equally clear
that there was an even shorter path from dance to drama.<a id='r853' /><a href='#f853' class='c012'><sup>[853]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>From this point of view, it is easy to understand why the
dance plays such a part in the beginning of nearly every
national literature, not only in the Dionysian origins of Greek
drama, but in less obvious ways. The same ecstasy, indeed,
appears again and again in a kind of panic dance; in the
summer of 1374 along the Rhine and in the Netherlands, and
again in 1418 at Strassburg, communal excitement went quite
mad in the St. John’s or the St. Vitus’s dance, vast crowds of
men and women leaping and shouting, garlanded, singing, as
they reeled, a refrain which might belong to the usual dances
of St. John’s Eve:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here Sent Johan, so, so,</div>
      <div class='line'>Vrisch ind vro,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here Sent Johan!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>until they fell exhausted, but still raving.<a id='r854' /><a href='#f854' class='c012'><sup>[854]</sup></a> These panic
dances reproduce in some features the mad dance of mænads
and all that “wild religious excitement,” that “Bacchic ecstasy,”
which lay behind the Hellenic drama, and anticipate
as mad a dance of as wild an ecstasy, though not religious,
when the mob of Paris dances the <i>carmagnole</i> to its own singing;
but all this belongs to the pathological side of the case,
and one turns to the harvest-field, and to the village oak,
where merry dances often set a rhythm heard in later and
nobler verse. Not long ago, poetry of every kind was
thought to start in some religious rite, and a god or goddess
lay hid under the most harmless rime of the yokel; of late,
however, a wholesome tendency has prevailed to stop the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>search of sky and storm-cloud and other far-away haunts for
an explanation of the rustic dance and of the rustic refrain.
On one hand, the chase, war, whatever concerned the routine
of nomadic life, and on the other hand, among agricultural
folk, the round of seedtime and harvest, days of plenty or of
want, and in both cases, the common joys and sorrows of mankind,
are now thought to be a better reason for communal
dance and song. Primitive man did not go about with his
eyes fixed upon the heavens; and it is not the goddess of
spring and sunshine transferred to those harvested crops as
signs of her presence which explains a Nerthus or a Ceres, but
rather a slow inference from local delight in harvest up to a
great feast of gathered and related tribes, involving wider
ideas of divinity and arriving by easy stages at the abstraction
of one beneficent deity sending out her largess of sun and
quickening showers. The dance, then, with nomadic tribes
was a triumph, an outburst of communal elation, dealing in
its mimicry with scenes of the war or hunt, and cadenced by
shout and song that echoed a clash of arms; with the agricultural
community it was a harvest-home, with recapitulation
of the rural year, imitated acts of sowing, planting, watching,
reaping, storing, which survive in some sort to this day. In
both kinds of life, nomadic and agricultural, the dance was an
essential part of such rites as the wedding and the funeral,
and is still considered in this way by peasants in remoter
Europe. Thus in Dalmatia and Montenegro,<a id='r855' /><a href='#f855' class='c012'><sup>[855]</sup></a> the <i>kollo</i>, that
is, circle, “the figure of all their dances, though the steps differ,”
is danced at weddings. “Twelve or thirteen women
... danced in a circle, singing a slow and rather plaintive
song ... while waiting for the bride.... In the meantime,
the men ... walked in procession to the court before
the church door, and danced in a circle.” Evidence of this
sort is everywhere; it has been studied under the refrain;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>but the festal idea may be repeated here in comment on the
meaning of our old English word and suffix <i>lâc</i>, and the related
Gothic <i>laiks</i>,<a id='r856' /><a href='#f856' class='c012'><sup>[856]</sup></a> German <i>leich</i>, originally the combination
of word, song, and dance—or march—in one communal
act,<a id='r857' /><a href='#f857' class='c012'><sup>[857]</sup></a> with an easy transition into the idea of battle, the “play
of spears,” where, indeed, this communal act always served as
prelude, as well as into the idea of feast, ceremony, merriment.
A festal song and dance after the fight, easily turned into
ritual and thanksgiving to the gods, but once mere fighting
the battle over again, was called in Norse the <i>sigrleikr</i>.<a id='r858' /><a href='#f858' class='c012'><sup>[858]</sup></a>
Further philology would not be in place; enough that the
earliest songs and poetry of Europe appear everywhere hand
in hand with the dance,<a id='r859' /><a href='#f859' class='c012'><sup>[859]</sup></a> and that this dance is partly the triumph
of victorious war, partly a triumph of peace and plenty,
always, however, a festal and communal affair.</p>

<p class='c013'>In considering this communal dance of Europe, one finds
that it is practically inseparable from song, and the song is
mainly sung by those who dance. In modern Greece, even,
Fauriel<a id='r860' /><a href='#f860' class='c012'><sup>[860]</sup></a> found that “every new dance was the result of a
new song, of which it formed the mimicry; it was never
danced without this song, and fell with it into oblivion.” A
study of the refrain showed how close this bond between song
and dance must have been; and one sees how slowly and
reluctantly the separation takes place, most reluctantly, of
course, in the games of children. It must also be borne in
mind that dancing by pairs is of comparatively recent date;
Neocorus, one will remember, says it was unknown among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>his peasant neighbours between the German ocean and the
Baltic until the middle of the sixteenth century, while Bladé
makes this way of dancing a stranger to the Gascon countryfolk
as late as seventy years ago. What they knew and practised
was the old round, danced once to the songs of the
dancers, but now dominated more and more by instruments;<a id='r861' /><a href='#f861' class='c012'><sup>[861]</sup></a>
the song, when used, is led by a soloist who improvises a line
or so which is repeated by the dancers in chorus, with a refrain
for all stanzas. This round, of course, is the <i>carole</i><a id='r862' /><a href='#f862' class='c012'><sup>[862]</sup></a> of
Romance literature, known later as the <i>branle</i>, a dance or
march of many, hand in hand, with chorus or refrain to time
the steps;<a id='r863' /><a href='#f863' class='c012'><sup>[863]</sup></a> it was the main amusement of aristocratic folk, but
derived directly from popular usage. Such an aristocratic
dance is described in the <i>Romaunt of the Rose</i>.<a id='r864' /><a href='#f864' class='c012'><sup>[864]</sup></a> Dante refers<a id='r865' /><a href='#f865' class='c012'><sup>[865]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>to the practise of singing with the dance; and if we had his
chapter on the <i>ballata</i>, we should have riches. On the dance-song
of these Romance nations, and its absolutely communal
origin, enough has been quoted already from such authors as
Wolf and Jeanroy; and it would be waste of time to heap up
evidence of the English ballad<a id='r866' /><a href='#f866' class='c012'><sup>[866]</sup></a> as it was danced in Elizabethan
fields, and when the youth went out to “mix their
songs and dances in the wood.” Dances of this sort we have
already noted not only among shepherds, but in the Elizabethan
theatre; besides the refrains of labour and merriment
to which the actors danced, ballads were in demand. A good
instance is in the old play of <i>Like Wil to Like</i>,<a id='r867' /><a href='#f867' class='c012'><sup>[867]</sup></a> where Nichol
Newfangle, the Devil, and Tom Collier are on the stage.
Says Nichol,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Godfather, wilt thou daunce a little before ye go home to hell?...</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, godfather, name what the daunce shall be.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Tom Coliar of Croydon hath solde his cole.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Why, then, haue at it by my father’s soule.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c014'>

<p class='c013'>[Nichol Newfangle must have a gittorn or some other instrument (if it
may bee), but if hee haue not, they must daunce about the place all three,
and sing this song that followeth, which must bee doon also althoug they
haue an instrumenth.]</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>And the song follows. Jigs were songs, largely improvised,
and sung by actors as they danced; they came after the
play.<a id='r868' /><a href='#f868' class='c012'><sup>[868]</sup></a> It was the fiddle, says Mr. Baring-Gould,<a id='r869' /><a href='#f869' class='c012'><sup>[869]</sup></a> “which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>banished the ballad as a song-accompaniment to a dance.
Nevertheless, as a very aged fiddler told me ... in his early
days the lads and maids always sang whilst dancing to
his music.” On the stage this substitution was more immediate
and thorough; so that in the days of George II,
when Nancy Dawson “produced the novelty of singing as
she danced,” she took the town by storm; though one may
conjecture that it was the survival, not the “novelty,”<a id='r870' /><a href='#f870' class='c012'><sup>[870]</sup></a> in
the case which thus aided her charm as a woman and her
grace as a dancer. For rural England, like rural Europe,
showed reluctance enough in giving up the good old way;
a Scottish parson, moreover, writing in 1793, tells of a large
stone, set up in one of the islands, about which he saw “fifty
of the inhabitants” gathered on the first day of the year,
and “dancing in the moonlight” with no other music than
their own singing.<a id='r871' /><a href='#f871' class='c012'><sup>[871]</sup></a> About such stones, but by preference
about the village linden,<a id='r872' /><a href='#f872' class='c012'><sup>[872]</sup></a> folk danced to their own singing
in Germany down to modern times; and as the dance was
an even movement in a ring, the dancers hand in hand, it
was quite possible for them to sing the ballads which seem
to us grotesquely unfit for the lively springing of single
performers as well as for the rapidly gliding couples. Leaping,
and livelier motions generally, followed the dance in a
ring; but it was to the latter that ballads were sung and in
the first instance composed.<a id='r873' /><a href='#f873' class='c012'><sup>[873]</sup></a> The dances which go mainly
to a refrain represent of course an older stage than those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>which are danced to a ballad, to a narrative song; the early
dance knows only present action, and exhorts or describes,
as in the Flemish dances<a id='r874' /><a href='#f874' class='c012'><sup>[874]</sup></a> now mainly relegated to children.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Mr. Thomas Hardy is so fond of reminding his readers,
this is a merry, dancing world no more; even youth can
hardly make shift “to revel in the general situation” as all
men used to do. <i>Weltschmerz</i> is to blame, no doubt, and
there is Mr. Baring-Gould’s fiddle, which has done a deal of
mischief. Rivals to the human voice, successful rivals,
were early at the dance,—harp, lyre, pipe, what not. South
Sea islanders were fain, not of these, but of the drum.
With the dominant note of alien music came a desire to
break up the ring, to dance in pairs, or even to listen and
look on. Meddlesome bishops and officials of every sort
were bound to destroy this communal dance as a place
of scandal; and we have seen how the chimney and the
clean, warm fireside and the lamp drew sober folk from the
village dances and left these to the baser element. One can
take quite seriously that petition<a id='r875' /><a href='#f875' class='c012'><sup>[875]</sup></a> of the would-be peasant
to restore legal sanction to the village dance; and one is
interested to hear the petitioner complain that it is the
violin now where once was the bagpipe,—and once, too,
he might have added, the echoing refrain. No, the dance
as well as the dancing song, the ballad proper, is going out
of date;<a id='r876' /><a href='#f876' class='c012'><sup>[876]</sup></a> and not only the dance in this communal and
social meaning, but the very fact of rhythm, which is the
soul of the dance. Children play these games less and less,
although the kindergarten makes some stand in the matter;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>and even in music, as Bücher<a id='r877' /><a href='#f877' class='c012'><sup>[877]</sup></a> points out in those pages to
which we have so often referred, teachers and artists are fain
to give rhythm an ancillary place and put melody, harmony,
in the foreground. One feels little displeasure, says Bücher,
at the sight of unrhythmic movements; and what would be
said of an orator who, like his Athenian brother, should address
a political assembly as his “fellow dancers”? But the
decline set in early; even in Sir Thomas Elyot’s day,<a id='r878' /><a href='#f878' class='c012'><sup>[878]</sup></a>
dancing is “that exercise whiche of the more parte of
sadde men”—serious folk, that is—“is so litle estimed.”
So, too, in imperial Rome. When the Romans hired
mimes to dance for them, some lover of the old ways
might have said of the communal dance, expression of
social union and social equality and the strong, compact
state, what the stern old orator said of his profession when
he first heard hired applause in the courts of law: <i>centumviri,
hoc artificium periit</i>,—“judges, oratory is doomed!” In both
cases one is dealing with the decline of communal force and
the growth of individual power.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our business, however, is with the past. It is clear that
movements of labour, particularly in a reminiscent festal
act, and movements of the communal dance, furnished the
raw material of poetry. In all cases the primitive dance,
or what seems to come nearest to that state of the art, is
a dance of masses of men for one purpose and to one exact
rhythm.<a id='r879' /><a href='#f879' class='c012'><sup>[879]</sup></a> Equal sets of movements gave the verse, and sets
of these sets gave in time the strophe. Communal interest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>resulting in the communal expression, added contents to form;
and shout, movement, cadence, are all born of this absolutely
social and communal impulse. To use the good old word,
here is the poetry of nature; facing this communal material,
what are we to say of the changes wrought upon it by
individual art?<a id='r880' /><a href='#f880' class='c012'><sup>[880]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />SCIENCE AND COMMUNAL POETRY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We have Dr. Johnson’s word for it that one does well “to
see great works in their seminal state, pregnant with latent
possibilities of excellence; nor could there be any more
delightful entertainment than to trace their gradual growth
and expansion.” So science came to think; and all the
works of nature and of man have been treated in this spirit
to the convincing of sane minds everywhere, except in the
domain of poetry. There one still clings to a paradise and a
perfect poet at the start,—perfect, that is, because he had
all the functions and privileges and opportunities of the
latter-day bard, and stood to his public as a poet stands to
the public of this age. A study of facts, records as well as survivals,
leads us to no such perfect primitive bard; at the end
of the path we see no dignified old gentleman in flowing robe,
with a long white beard, upturned eyes, and a harp clasped to
his bosom, but rather a ring of savages dancing uncouthly to
the sound of their own voices in a rhythmic but inharmonious
chant. This, however, is only saying that poetry, like all
human institutions, like the earth itself, goes back to rude
and barren beginnings; and the lowest stratum of poetry to
which one can come either by sight or by inference is only what
one ought to expect from the doctrine of evolution, applicable
in this case as in any other case. With a sense not
intended by Browning, “rock’s the song-soil rather,” and
even fossil signs of life are few. But it is precisely here that
Johnson’s unconscious praise of these studies should be borne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>in mind. Not the bard come down from Olympus, with
majesty in his mien and the light of divine song shed about
him, singing to his rapt hearers of the deep things of life, is
the nobler view: nobler by far is the sight of those little
groups gathered on the marches that lay between the old
beast and the new man, facing inexorable powers which had
crushed out life upon life before, and whole systems of life;
dimly conscious of a force that treads down the individual and
dooms the solitary to defeat; dimly conscious, too, of the resisting
power that lies in coherence, union, common front in a
common cause; marshalled by the instinct of kind into a
tentative confederation of single resources; and so beginning
the long battle which humanity is still waging against
foes unseen as well as seen. The first cry of emotional consent
along with the consenting step, the cry that remembered
a triumph found in instinctive common action, and felt itself
to be prophetic of a triumph yet to come; this concerted step
and shout which seemed the expression of concerted purpose,
of communal will, force, effectiveness, has more in it even for
the man of sentiment than can be found in any flight of
poetry in later time. But we are not seeking sentiment in
the case; and having come in this rude dance and song, so it
would seem, to the beginnings of poetry, we ask what was the
beginning of this beginning. If one must have a formula
for the process, it need not be in those intolerant terms of
personal initiative and gregarious imitation upon which
M. Tarde insists so strenuously, but rather in the mild and
quite as scientific terms of consent, the consent of instinctive
individual gestures and sounds due to the perception by a
group of human beings that common action makes unity out of
diversity. Art is of social origin; that is the thesis of Guyau
in his well-known book; and the social sense precedes any
relation of master and pupil, leader and followers. It is
overwhelmingly probable that rhythm, the simplest form of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>social consent, was the earliest form of a discovery which
made social progress possible. Still, this probability must
not be taken for granted.</p>

<p class='c013'>The question, like the democratic thought of a century and
more ago, has an outer and an inner circle.<a id='r881' /><a href='#f881' class='c012'><sup>[881]</sup></a> For the latter,
let us ask whether poetry, queen of the arts, is an art in the
sense of something invented by the artist, not only in details,
but in essence. The arts of life belong to the artist; but is
the artist anterior in every way to his art? Is there no spontaneous,
instinctive background? In the first place, one must
guard against a fallacy of terms. The invention of a tool,
for example, even though it be “organic projection,” is different
in kind from the invention of a poem, which, by the principles
of æsthetic, has no one practical end in view,—for
theory, at least; in reality, the inventor of a poem nowadays
has a practical end in view, the sale of his verse, and Scherer
carried this commercial idea back to the very origins, setting
up a primitive literary market, with supply and demand,
poet and public, bargains, sales, entertainer and audience,
on the very tree-platform of our hairy ancestors. But Scherer
fell into absurdities. Gigadibs the literary man does not
thrive in those regions; and one cannot reduce the primitive
choral to terms of artist, invention, public, sale. If anything
has been made clear in preceding pages of this book, if anything
can be made clear in the study of improvisation about
to follow, if there is any certain curve of evolution in the
course of poetry, it is that the passive element, the audience,
the receptive public, disappears inevitably as one recedes
from conditions of the present time, and that the throng as a
productive active body assumes more and more the functions
now regarded as belonging almost exclusively to the individual.
Invention itself has been reduced to a convenient absurdity,
for this very article of rhythm, by M. Kawczynski, in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>essay on rhythmic origins.<a id='r882' /><a href='#f882' class='c012'><sup>[882]</sup></a> Nobody denies that an Alcæus
may invent an Alcaic strophe,<a id='r883' /><a href='#f883' class='c012'><sup>[883]</sup></a> that another master may hit
upon the elegiac couplet; but this vivacious essay declares
that rhythm itself was invented by some thoughtful benefactor
of the race, some genius of prehistoric times. A book
published in the same year, the <i>Æsthetics of Movement</i>, by
M. Souriau,<a id='r884' /><a href='#f884' class='c012'><sup>[884]</sup></a> had made temperate protest against Mr. Herbert
Spencer’s doctrine<a id='r885' /><a href='#f885' class='c012'><sup>[885]</sup></a> of the universality of rhythm in the realm
of nature, and had asserted that rhythm, exceptional in nature,
is nevertheless “the constant law of muscular movements,”
and not the result of will. But this spontaneity of rhythm in
the motion and muscular exertion of man, this tendency in
each of our motor organs “to adopt a fixed rhythm which
becomes its normal movement,” is precisely what M. Kawczynski
will not allow; he is bent upon banishing “the false
system of spontaneity” from its last place of refuge and will
hound it off the face of the earth. Not only was this or that
dance invented, this or that march and walk; dancing, marching,
leaping, yes, walking, are inventions all. This is very
clear language of M. Kawczynski, but it is a trifle too clear;
one asks for a bill of particulars,—first for an explanation of
the inventive process, and secondly for an account of the imitation;
and here one meets difficulties. The individual mind
plays about general instincts, modifies them, develops them
into a thousand forms, precisely as it does with the raw material
of nature. It invents a dance as modification of the general
instinct to dance; it invents the steam-engine, but is not
yet credited with inventing steam and iron. So one easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>understands the invention of a distinct song; but what of
singing? Or say of breathing? The Dogberry who says
that these things come by nature, and asks how they could
come by art, is pained to find the advocate of invention wrapping
himself in a cloak of biological mystery not unlike the
theological garment donned, under similar questions, by Jacob
Grimm himself. We shall see that in the outer circle this question
is answered by M. Tarde with a reference to the cell;
ultimate individual invention is an affair of the individual cell;
while the process itself is a mystery, described only in the
most modest and euphemistic hints, and to stare at it would
be the part of peeping Tom. M. Kawczynski makes no effort
to explain invention, but simply asserts it; and although imitation
is a clearer case, yet even here he says things which are
not good for the interests of his theory. He is safe so long
as he keeps to general terms and describes all literature as
a gigantic system of borrowings,—German from Roman,
Roman from Greek, Greek from Egyptian mayhap, and
Egyptian from creditors unknown, all imitation, with here
and there a bit of invention going on decently behind closed
doors. But M. Kawczynski dares too much, and blunders in
the particular case. A witness should be taken from the box
when he tries to help his cause by making German Siegfried
an imitated compound of Jason, Achilles, and Perseus; by
naming Otfried as the founder of really Germanic literature;
by making alliteration in Norse an imitation of German,
which got it from Anglo-Saxons, who got it from the Irish,
who got it from the Latin; and by calling Germanic verse
itself an imitation of the classic hexameter.<a id='r886' /><a href='#f886' class='c012'><sup>[886]</sup></a> “Historic influences,”
one is told, “are stronger than the natural and proper
gifts of any people”; but are not natural and proper gifts
themselves the strongest of historic influences? This question
is worth a glance by the way.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>No one denies the great part played in poetry by imitation;
but it is not the only element in the case. True, it is the
most obvious element. Comparative literature, as a science,
is young. The task put before its followers was plain
enough; they had first of all to sift the material, to note
where deep has called unto deep in the influence of one poet
upon another, as well as to follow the fortunes of a primitive
bagman’s jest carried on the old trading routes from land to
land and starting up at last as <i>conte</i> or <i>schwank</i> in a hundred
scattered communities, in cloister, school, and court. But this
is not all, and the task is not done even when one has struck
the balance between the borrowings of a poet and what one
suffers to pass as his individual and original genius. Abused
as the terms have been, the genius of time, place, community,
is still a factor in the growth of any literature; and M. Gaston
Paris, who has done so much for the study of sources, is
emphatic on this point. In several passages, notably in a
discussion of the method to be followed in studying poetry
of the people,<a id='r887' /><a href='#f887' class='c012'><sup>[887]</sup></a> he sets a bound to the theory of borrowings,
and insists upon the common fund or “patrimony” of
national tradition. Steinthal, too, is not altogether negligible
with his query; why assume, he asks,<a id='r888' /><a href='#f888' class='c012'><sup>[888]</sup></a> that because Europe
imported so much, she must have been herself sterile? That
old Aryan patrimony, to be sure, as source of myth, legend,
poem, rite, is out of favour, perhaps definitely abandoned;
but Comparetti,<a id='r889' /><a href='#f889' class='c012'><sup>[889]</sup></a> who approves this abandonment, is full of
zeal for the development of all poetry, provided it has the
spontaneous and native note, within the limits of its own
nation and its own tongue. Borrowing is, after all, incidental,
however conspicuous in fact; and it would be a wild system
of economics which should explain the industrial life of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>world as purely a matter of exchange, of debtor and creditor,
without any hint of agriculture and manufactures. One sees
all the faring of ship and car, the tumult of docks, drays,
storehouses, the stir in counting-rooms, banks, exchange;
what of plough and mill and mine? It is just these, so to
speak, that one fails to see in such clever literary balancing
of accounts as certain scholars have made in the study of
Scandinavian ballads. Take a holiday throng of the unlettered
mediæval community, intent upon song and dance,
all dancing and all singing; will no one tell us what they
sing? A score of scholars. They produce the ballad,—no
easy feat,—and for this alone deserve lasting gratitude. As
they find it, it is not likely to be merely a local affair, for such
things seldom come upon record, although it is quite clear
that perhaps the majority of ballads in this class were of
purely local interest. Very likely, however, it is borrowed,
and the scholar—again, no easy feat—traces the loan to its
source. The form of the stanza may be imported, too, with
its simple air; and even now and then the peculiar rhythm
of the lines may be an echo of alien song. Here, then, is
imitation; it need not have been imitation, and in some other
place was doubtless a home product throughout; but here
imitation must be conceded. Our ingenious literary accountant,
however, is emboldened to take another step; the impulse
which drives that throng to express its feelings by rhythm,
movement, cry, he takes away from instinct and sets down
to the credit of some other community; the very dancing and
singing, that is, he regards as an imitated, borrowed thing.
Rosenberg, in his book on the <i>Intellectual Life of Scandinavia</i>,<a id='r890' /><a href='#f890' class='c012'><sup>[890]</sup></a>
tries to prove that “dancing and singing to the
dance” came to Norsemen from the Celts; and to make this
probable, he has recourse to that perilous figure, the universal
negative. There were no dancing-songs, he says, in oldest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>English; dancing-song and refrain, he argues from records
notoriously imperfect, were also unknown to the early German,
and came to him as a Celtic export, although the German
was the first to use these forms in narrative.<a id='r891' /><a href='#f891' class='c012'><sup>[891]</sup></a> That is,
the Germans had at first no song for the dance, but got it from
the Celts, who in their turn had not used the narrative song
for dancing, and by way of barter imported it, as among the
Bretons, from a German source. The refrain and the dance,
novelties both, came with viking spoils into Scandinavian life,
made things “lighter and more gay,” and “for the first time
gave ladies the chance of active participation in social enjoyment.”
In Iceland, Rosenberg goes on to say, there was no
dancing until about the year 1200;<a id='r892' /><a href='#f892' class='c012'><sup>[892]</sup></a> though folk there took
hugely to the thing when they once had it. Moreover, “all
agree that this dance and song was at first an exclusive prerogative
of noble families.” A thousand years, then, one is
to conceive the case, foot and voice went never paired in
Norland, dance and refrain were unknown, until example
came from the South! <i>Tantae molis erat</i>; to set folk dancing
to their own songs needed such ponderous machinery and
such a stretch of time! Had Rosenberg’s comparative literature
only made itself comparative beyond the shreds and
patches of written records, beyond the narrow range of
Europe and the mediæval limits; had he only taken Adam
Smith’s or Lord Monboddo’s interest in African natives like
that one who danced a war dance before the genial Adam and
his friends, compelling all hands to leap upon chairs and
tables for safety! Rosenberg and scholars of his class are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>not comparative enough; they forget wider and more important
reaches.<a id='r893' /><a href='#f893' class='c012'><sup>[893]</sup></a> The habit of turning an event or a situation
straightway into improvised verse with gestures and dancing,
is so well attested in the accounts of savage life, so well
attested in cases where isolated and unlettered communities
in modern Europe have been left to their own “literary”
devices,<a id='r894' /><a href='#f894' class='c012'><sup>[894]</sup></a> that in the face of such evidence the assertion that
Norse folk waited a thousand years for a hint from the Celts
before they began to dance to rough chorus and refrain of
their own singing, falls like a house of cards. Borrowing
money is not a sign of bankruptcy; and the valuable affirmative
evidence of literary loans which these scholars give us
is half spoiled by the absurdity of their universal negative in
regard to native production. For example, we know that
Finns, in very recent times, borrowed a store of Swedish ballads,
and that the name <i>veisa</i>,<a id='r895' /><a href='#f895' class='c012'><sup>[895]</sup></a> used in Finnish for a ballad,
is taken from that source; but, as every one knows, the Finns
had their own native songs. Suppose, now, that these native
songs had long since disappeared, as they doubtless would
have disappeared under the circumstances of primitive Scandinavian
ballads; and how cheerfully the literary accountant
could have assured his reader that there were no Finnish
songs whatever until those Swedish loans were made!</p>

<p class='c013'>Let us go back now to the main question, and take its
outer circle. Here one is told to blot from one’s dictionary
such words as <i>instinct</i>, <i>spontaneity</i>, <i>homogeneous</i>; but,
with these well erased, how is one to speak of that group
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>of primitive men huddled on the frontier of civilization?
They have no instincts, no spontaneous gestures and cries;
they are not homogeneous, and no homogeneous expression
can come out of them. They cannot borrow; for they are
opening the first concern of its kind. What are they doing,
then? Getting ready, one is told, for a game of follow-the-leader,
the game of all civilized and uncivilized beings, and
the law of all animate things. Here is a formula not merely
valid in the explanation of literary progress, but the last
word of philosophy itself. It is labour lost to set up the
spontaneous, communal impulse as a factor in solving these
problems of primitive poetry, if the spontaneous and the
communal are impossible ideas, mere superstitions, props on
which rationalism once leaned in passing from the grosser
explanations of ghosts, gods, what not, but now broken and
cast as rubbish to the void. By the theory of M. Tarde, for
example, there is no spontaneity possible; rhythm in its
widest sense, dancing, even tears and laughter, breathing,
all cease to be outcome of emotion common and instinctive;
they are imitation by one individual of another individual, or,
to take refuge in biology, of one cell of another cell. The
microcosm is here no figure of speech; in this little world of
man is a commonwealth of individual cells, with crossing and
varied interests; an inventive, masterful cell takes the lead,
sweeps along most of the other cells, which imitate and obey,
opposes and destroys others, adapts itself by compromise to
a few more,—and this is man, just as it is society: invention,
imitation, but no spontaneity. Invention is the rare
and difficult factor; imitation is the constant factor.<a id='r896' /><a href='#f896' class='c012'><sup>[896]</sup></a> That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>is, to put the case more concisely, Tarde attacks two theses,
the assertion of spontaneity in a throng and the assertion
that development is from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this is not so new as it seems to be. It is early eighteenth-century
philosophy translated into late nineteenth-century
science. It is a reaction from a reaction; for Wilhelm
von Humboldt, Hamann, Herder, and the rest, “tired
of kings,” tired of the “great man,” turned to man himself,
to humanity, nature, to great forces revealed in human institutions
everywhere. Speech, said Humboldt, is no invention;
it is an energy, a power. At the beginning, says M.
Tarde,<a id='r897' /><a href='#f897' class='c012'><sup>[897]</sup></a> “a savage genius” in a single family, invented the
earliest form of language; and families everywhere came to
borrow this anthropoid’s linguistic fire. M. Tarde is suavely
bent on exterminating the idea of nature. Even Darwin had
said speech was half art, half instinct; and an early Darwinian,
Lord Monboddo,<a id='r898' /><a href='#f898' class='c012'><sup>[898]</sup></a> believing that “everything of art must
be founded on nature,” derived language from “natural
cries.” Nature, says M. Tarde, is a superstition; and with
it he tosses away instinct and spontaneity. The solution for
every possible problem of man’s destiny he seeks in one of
those <i>cerveaux de génie</i>, savage or civilized, heterogeneous
factors of life, like the masterful cell from which all has
come and to which all shall yet return. All social adaptation
is reduced to the work “of two men, of whom one answers,
by word or by deed, to the question, verbal or silent,
of the other.” Men are alike, think alike, do alike, not by
any law or by any instinct of species, but by this fact of imitation;
any group, large or small, will consist of two parts,
one learning and one teaching, one producing and one consuming,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>“one actor, poet, artist, and the other looker-on,
reader, amateur.”<a id='r899' /><a href='#f899' class='c012'><sup>[899]</sup></a> The group of two individuals, the harmony
of it, Tarde now pushes back to an earlier harmony
between two ideas in the brain of the individual inventor;
and this is to stretch into the infinitesimal. How, he cries
in an eloquent passage,<a id='r900' /><a href='#f900' class='c012'><sup>[900]</sup></a> how can a Spencer, as well as the
man in the street, go on treating this infinitesimal as of no
moment, as a homogeneous, neutral thing, with naught in it
spiritual and distinct? Why make the vast range of space
your theatre of existence? Within this despised infinitesimal,
mayhap, lie the chances of death or immortality, the secret
of being itself. And we call this ovule, this part of the
ovule, this part of the part,—undifferentiated!<a id='r901' /><a href='#f901' class='c012'><sup>[901]</sup></a> Darwin is
right in his general theory of descent, but he is wrong in his
explanation, thinks M. Tarde; for the true cause of the species
is “the secret of the cells, <i>the invention of some early
ovule endowed with peculiar and rich originality</i>.” What,
once more, what of our little group of primitive men, their
instinct of kind, their spontaneous gestures and steps and
cries, their homogeneous character and therefore homogeneous
expression? Seek out the masterful cell in the
masterful brain of the masterful leader of that sorry set of
imitators, and it will tell all secrets of civilization and
human progress, poetry and the arts included. There is
no “society” for M. Tarde, and, for the sake of dignified
and decent thought, no <i>milieu</i>, no “they,”<a id='r902' /><a href='#f902' class='c012'><sup>[902]</sup></a>—that figment of
nonsense in the phrase “they say,”—no “social forces.”
Instead of explaining the small by the great, the detail by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>mass, he explains a group of similar things by the accumulation
of minor elementary processes, the great by the small,
the mass by the detail. There is for M. Tarde no genius of
a race, of a language, of a religion; at the best, this genius
of the people is a label for the individuals, or a sort of composite
photograph. Hennequin<a id='r903' /><a href='#f903' class='c012'><sup>[903]</sup></a> argued in the same way
against an English type in literature, against a Norman or
a Gascon type in French; it is worth noting that his arguments
and Tarde’s philosophy were anticipated at one of
the Magny dinners in January, 1866. “Taine asserted,” so
the <i>Goncourt Journal</i> reports, “that all men of talent are the
product of their environment. We took the other side.
‘Where are you going to find,’ we said, ‘the exotic root of
Chateaubriand,—a pineapple growing in the barracks!’
Gautier came to our support, and maintained that the brain
of an artist was the same thing under the Pharaohs that it
is now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>M. Tarde, however, with his followers, is by no means in
undisputed possession of the field, whether in sociology or
in literature. Gumplowicz<a id='r904' /><a href='#f904' class='c012'><sup>[904]</sup></a> declares that “the behaviour
of collective entities is determined by natural and sociological
laws, and not by the motives and natural qualities
of individuals.” Moreover, as he says, the horde and the
social group make a unit, and this is unlike its parts; it cannot
be inferred from its parts. Social thought came before
individual thought. Some of the best scholars in sociology
have come out frankly for dualism; and in the opinion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Dr. Barth,<a id='r905' /><a href='#f905' class='c012'><sup>[905]</sup></a> dualism has now been proved for the past and
recognized for present and future. Professor Giddings<a id='r906' /><a href='#f906' class='c012'><sup>[906]</sup></a>
takes this view and offers proof; he puts the consciousness
of kind before invention and initiation, for society, as he
says, is an organization and not an organism. Perhaps a
majority of French scholars hold against M. Tarde; and
while Germany has been rampant for individualism, a distinct
reaction has set in with the work of Bernheim, of
Lamprecht, and of Barth himself. As Ranke grew older,
says Lamprecht, he grew less willing to lay stress on great
personalities in history, which, he thought, must more and
more find its account in the movement and condition of
masses. Comte is not discredited in the spirit of his theory,
whatever has become of the details; and, turning to psychology,
one finds Wundt<a id='r907' /><a href='#f907' class='c012'><sup>[907]</sup></a> actually defending the social
mind, so vehemently attacked by Paul in his <i>Principles</i>.
Wundt says there is such a thing as the <i>volksseele</i>, the sum
of experiences in a multitude; and the products of such
communal experiences, due to the coexistence and mutual
working of many minds, cannot be explained by conditions
of the individual mind. Language, myth, and custom, he says,
are the three products of this mind or soul of the people;
and it is not hard to find room for poetry in the province
lying between speech and myth.<a id='r908' /><a href='#f908' class='c012'><sup>[908]</sup></a> The problem thus stated
and studied by Wundt has been undertaken by several other
writers, notably by M. Le Bon,<a id='r909' /><a href='#f909' class='c012'><sup>[909]</sup></a> and even, in a hostile spirit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>by M. Tarde himself. Von Hartmann<a id='r910' /><a href='#f910' class='c012'><sup>[910]</sup></a> studied the “collective
mind” as long ago as 1869, and fitted it into his
philosophy of the unconscious; while the <i>Journal of Demo-psychology
and Philology</i>, of Steinthal and Lazarus, fought a
losing fight for demos in the old days from 1860, merging at
last into the <i>Journal of the Ethnological Society</i>.<a id='r911' /><a href='#f911' class='c012'><sup>[911]</sup></a> It is the
fashion to laugh at this old journal, and it had its defects;
the student of poetry, however, will do well to bear in mind
that Ten Brink,<a id='r912' /><a href='#f912' class='c012'><sup>[912]</sup></a> in his spirited account of communal song
as the basis of English poetry, expressly declares that he
“learned the most” about his subject from an article by
Steinthal in the same periodical. Again, there is Bastian
for ethnology; obscure in expression, hazy in thought, he
backs his pet idea of the <i>völkergedanken</i> with a range of
ethnological facts which no one will neglect or despise.
These are positive considerations; and with them must go
a negative but valuable result due to the failure of Tarde,
Kawczynski, and others, in applying their arguments to facts.
Take M. Tarde’s signally unfortunate illustration of his idea
that invention is the only initial power with which one
reckons in literature,—that poetry, for example, always
“begins<a id='r913' /><a href='#f913' class='c012'><sup>[913]</sup></a> with a book”—a book—“an <i>épopée</i>, some poetical
work of great relative perfection, ... some high initial
source.” And what are the examples of this law of poetic
origins? “The <i>Iliad</i>, the Bible, Dante.” Here is sheer
absurdity. Each of these cases tends to prove the exact
opposite of what M. Tarde would have it prove. Did he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>come to this fatal idea, that all great literature starts with
a great book, by reading Hugo’s preface to <i>Cromwell</i>?<a id='r914' /><a href='#f914' class='c012'><sup>[914]</sup></a>
Worse, even, is his assertion that “modern literature begins
with the <i>Romance of the Rose</i>.”<a id='r915' /><a href='#f915' class='c012'><sup>[915]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The theory of M. Tarde, noteworthy as it is, and salutary
as some of its appeals must prove in correcting romantic
extravagances, cannot be upheld even as a theory, and breaks
down lamentably when applied to poetical facts. A saner
belief would accept the immense part played by imitation, but
would refuse to give it sole possession of the field. It is the
clash of communal and individual tendencies,<a id='r916' /><a href='#f916' class='c012'><sup>[916]</sup></a> of centripetal
and centrifugal, with which M. Tarde forgets to reckon; now
the individual invents, rules, awes, masters, and the throng
follow like sheep, and now again this throng is—not <i>are</i>—tyrannical
to such a degree that the philosopher of that
epoch cries out that there is no individual initiative, all is law,
natural forces, social forces,—and so comes to an extreme as
illogical as that of M. Tarde. It is true that a work of art is
not a mere registry of popular sentiment, of environment, of
the temper of the time; it is also true that the artist cannot take
himself out of those influences. Art is social, and without
society would not exist. It is simple recognition of facts to
assert that art, like religion, law, custom, serves as an index
for tendencies which underlie the thought and emotion of an
epoch; it works below the surface, this movement, and is
often belied by all signs that can be read on the surface,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>until suddenly these change too, and the period has registered
its characteristics after the fashion of a clock which moves its
hands only at the end of each minute. It is true, moreover,
that this movement must belong to the body in which it takes
place; yet it is also true that the movements of communal
thought, as Wundt pointed out, are different in kind from
the movements of individual thought.</p>

<p class='c013'>But this is too fine-spun stuff for that group of primitive
men concerned with their first effort at song. Granted the
communal force with which we would endow them, what of
the instinctive step, gesture, cry,—can these really be instinctive
and not mere imitation of a leader?</p>

<p class='c013'>As to instinctive utterance, that idea, though somewhat
rudely shaken, still stands.<a id='r917' /><a href='#f917' class='c012'><sup>[917]</sup></a> There are instinctive sounds,
and man is or was no exception to the rule. The social
influence, assumed by everybody as real cause of articulate
speech, would work not upon a new sound “invented” by
some primitive genius, but upon the instinctive sounds
uttered by each unit of a throng. That individuals discovered
or invented modifications of these sounds, no one will
deny; but the conditions of primitive life were those of a
horde, with individuals at a minimum of importance, so that
the earliest progress in speech and poetry was due to the
almost unconscious changes made by a festal throng under
the excitement of social consent,—a very different thing
from invention and imitation as the terms now hold.
Whether one wishes to carry farther this mutual influence
of man upon man in a throng equally active in all its parts,
or not, is of little moment. The conditions of progress in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>speech and song were immediately communal, in strong
contrast to the isolated, individual, mediating conditions
of such progress at the present day. All we ask of biology
is the concession of instinct; at the basis of human
poetry, that vast edifice of art, and, as it seems to the
modern man, of nothing but art, lie instinctive utterances,
homogeneous, if one may judge by chick and bird,<a id='r918' /><a href='#f918' class='c012'><sup>[918]</sup></a> and
subject to their first modifications not from individual effort
but from social consent and the enormous force of communal
emotion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Psychology, too, joins biology in allowing that instinctive
forms of utterance and expression in primitive times may
have led to that <i>gemeinsames dichten</i> in chorus, refrain,
dance, which is claimed for nature and opposed to art.
Imitation, in any sense that concerns the argument in hand,
is after all a matter of deliberation, reason, choice; but the
expression of emotion in children as in savages is rapid,
instantaneous, instinctive. “Except fear,” says Ribot,<a id='r919' /><a href='#f919' class='c012'><sup>[919]</sup></a> “all
primary emotions imply tendencies to movement, sometimes
blind and violent, like natural forces. This is seen in infants,
animals, savages, the barbarians of the first centuries of our
era.... The passage of emotion into action, good or bad,
is instantaneous, rapid, and fatal as a reflex movement.”
Panic fright, where animals are almost paralyzed, is, indeed,
a matter of rapid suggestion and imitation in cases
where the cause is not apparent; but panic elation is active,
a movement, a sympathy, an instinctive consent of voice and
limb. Moreover, the throng is always to be kept in mind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>and the analogy of children in a family, as well as of savages
brought among civilized folk, is to be held resolutely
back; it is no analogy at all. Who played the suggestive
part of parent, of grown or civilized people, to the imitation
of a mass of human beings in those earliest days?
Horde conditions are too easily forgotten, and psychology
needs to take them more into account, just as it is taking
instinct again into favour. Beginning about 1850, a movement
against instinct is plainly traced through the writings of
men like Bain and A. R. Wallace; but the feud was carried
too far, and Professor Karl Groos, in one of the best books<a id='r920' /><a href='#f920' class='c012'><sup>[920]</sup></a>
which have lately appeared on this subject, notes the reaction
not only in Wundt, but in Lotze, Spencer, Sully, and Ribot,
against this effort to blot the word instinct from our dictionaries.
Groos, who has ample respect for imitation as a leading
force in development of both body and mind, refuses to
give it absolute rule. Play, he says, is not imitation, “but,
if the phrase will pass, a foreboding of the serious occupation
of the individual”;<a id='r921' /><a href='#f921' class='c012'><sup>[921]</sup></a> and again, “particularly in the most
important and most elementary forms of play, there can be
no question either of imitating the animal’s own previous
activity, <i>or of imitating the activity of other individuals</i>.”
Mr. Lloyd Morgan allowed that his young moor-hen, with
imitation out of the question, executing “a pretty and characteristic
dance,” showed instinct “even in the narrower acceptation
of the term.” Now if this solitary activity is “congenital”
and “instinctive,” imitation must also yield some ground to
instinct in gregarious play of animals and in communal play
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>of men. When Wundt<a id='r922' /><a href='#f922' class='c012'><sup>[922]</sup></a> says that human life “is permeated
through and through with instinctive action, determined in
part by intelligence and volition,” he states in scientific terms
the old dualism of nature and art, of throng and artist, at
which the rationalists of criticism have directed so many
attacks. That fascinating book, Hudson’s <i>Naturalist on the
La Plata</i>, gives evidence about gregarious play among
animals.<a id='r923' /><a href='#f923' class='c012'><sup>[923]</sup></a> All mammals and birds, he says, have “more or
less regular or set performances with or without sound, or
composed of sound exclusively ... performances which in
many animals are only discordant cries and chorus and
uncouth irregular motions,” yet, “in the more aerial, graceful,
and melodious kinds, take immeasurably higher, more complex,
and more beautiful forms.” Again, “every species, or
group of species, has its own inherited form or style of performance;
and however rude and irregular this may be ...
<i>that is the form in which the feeling will always be expressed</i>.”
Plainly, for whatever reason, the individual is here under the
control of the species; and imitation cannot be the sole
explaining cause either of the impulse or of the performance.
In fact, as Groos concludes,<a id='r924' /><a href='#f924' class='c012'><sup>[924]</sup></a> in regard to play “the instincts
are sole foundation. Foundation, for not all play is pure
work of instinct; on the contrary, the higher one proceeds,
the richer and more delicate grow those psychological elements
which are added to the simple impulse of nature,
ennoble it, elevate it, and now and again almost conceal it.
But the foundation is instinct.”</p>

<p class='c013'>What Professor Groos has not done in his interesting books
is to give adequate importance to the choral and communal
fact; he neglects the antithesis between common action and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>imitated action in a social group. This choral impulse may
be referred to a pleasure in common, instinctive action, rarely
noted by psychologists, which is a quite different affair from
the pleasure of imitating as well as from the pleasure of seeing
or hearing a thing done. Groos himself notes that the
mass-play of birds is like the mass-dance of primitive men
which sprang from sexual excitement. Still, in the table<a id='r925' /><a href='#f925' class='c012'><sup>[925]</sup></a>
printed at the end of his earlier book one sees how completely
he leaves the choral and communal case out of account.
He recognizes in the first column of this table the representation
of self, the personal impulse, but not as a
social expression by social consent; these forms of play
should differ according to the solitary or social character of
the performance, and this again not simply in terms of personal
instinct and communal imitation. There is a social or
communal personality, at all events where human society is
in question, created by any combined action and deriving
from the instinctive, not necessarily imitative acts of individuals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>as conscious parts of a whole. Society is not the
sum of individuals, but the mass of them, differing as a mass
in its parts from these parts as individuals, plus the greater
or less influence of generations of previous masses,—in traditions,
custom, and the like. Dead and living form a combination
partly organic and vital, partly immaterial; against
this stands the centrifugal, thinking, protesting, innovating
individual. But even ignoring tradition, the difference holds.
If I vote with a party, and “it” gains, my joy is not mine
plus the joy of all who voted with me, but mine because I
am a part of the voting body. How much stronger the
direct case under almost exclusively communal conditions!
Communal elation, quite apart from personal elation, any one
can still study in his own mind, but under conditions which
make his elation a thing of shame to his intellectual, critical
self. This shame, which breeds the “mugwump” and
breaks up political parties, barely existed in primitive life,—so
sociology concludes with no dissenting voice. Communal
elation, instinctive expression in consent, began, by Donovan’s
reckoning,<a id='r926' /><a href='#f926' class='c012'><sup>[926]</sup></a> in the spontaneous “play-excitement” of a
festal throng, which may or may not have parallels in the
play of beasts and birds; here were human fellowship, homogeneous
conditions, “a common cause of excitement,” and a
common expression of it in the social consent of rhythm.
Donovan, too, has a table<a id='r927' /><a href='#f927' class='c012'><sup>[927]</sup></a> to illustrate all this; “play-excitement,”
instinctive, drifts into “habits of movement” and into
song; individual song-making is a later affair, and is developed
“out of the racial memories.” So great a factor was
this communal elation, this play-excitement, in the making of
poetry. But life has never been all play; poetry echoes,
perhaps even clearer than in the case of play, the stress and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>pain of human effort. As was shown in preceding pages,
Bücher laid stress upon the instinctive cries and motions of
labour, the rhythm of individual and social work. Rhythm,
he insisted, “springs from the organic nature of man”; it is
automatic, instinctive,<a id='r928' /><a href='#f928' class='c012'><sup>[928]</sup></a> and nowhere so much as in labour.
Nor were the realms of play and labour very far apart.
Treading the grapes of Dionysos, treading the wild dance of
Dionysos,—there was little space between the two activities,
and no distinction at all so far as rhythm and instinctive
motion were concerned. In brief, whether one takes the
instinct of play, as preparation for work, with Groos, or
the play-excitement, with Donovan, or the instinctive rhythm
furnished by work pure and simple, with Bücher, there is
ample recognition in each case for the spontaneous, and in
two of the cases for the communal, as essential elements
in the beginnings of poetry. The conclusions of psychology<a id='r929' /><a href='#f929' class='c012'><sup>[929]</sup></a>
and sociology are still in tune with the dualism
hinted long since by Aristotle, and stated just a century ago
by A. W. Schlegel. Aristotle referred the beginning of
poetry to two instincts,—imitation and “the instinct for
harmony and rhythm”; but the art itself came only with
individual effort. “Persons ... with this natural gift little
by little improved upon their early efforts till their rude
improvisations gave birth to poetry. Poetry now branched
off in two directions <i>according to the individual character
of the writers</i>.”<a id='r930' /><a href='#f930' class='c012'><sup>[930]</sup></a> So, too, he speaks of tragedy, which,
like comedy, “was at first mere improvisation,” festal excitement
of the throng;<a id='r931' /><a href='#f931' class='c012'><sup>[931]</sup></a> and there is the same hint of communal
spontaneity coming under artistic control when Aristotle notes
that “Æschylus diminished the importance of the chorus,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>and when he speaks of a time when “poetry was of the
satyric order, <i>and had greater affinities with dancing</i>.” Would
there were more historical work of this sort from that “honest
and keen-eyed observer,” as Schlegel calls him! Could
the dualism be more plainly set forth? Döring<a id='r932' /><a href='#f932' class='c012'><sup>[932]</sup></a> points out that
Aristotle distinguishes two kinds of dithyramb; one is natural,
spontaneous, improvised, and this is nothing, in his eyes, but
the raw material of poetry; the other is the dithyramb of art.
Schlegel’s position has been defined already, but part of
a brief<a id='r933' /><a href='#f933' class='c012'><sup>[933]</sup></a> for a lecture which was never written out, may be
noted as in point; he is more generous to the ruder stage of
verse than Aristotle seems to be. “The idea of a natural
history of poetry.... End of this. <i>Transition to art and to
the consciousness of it. All primitive, original songs inspiration
of the moment.</i>” Now the evidence of ethnology has set
this last remark upon the surest base;<a id='r934' /><a href='#f934' class='c012'><sup>[934]</sup></a> no fact is better established
for savage poetry. Creatures of impulse, without
individual thinking, without individual plan and purpose, with
uniform and circumscribed conditions, with homogeneous natures,
they are swayed by communal emotion to a degree
which seems incredible to the man of culture. Schlegel himself
had an eye on this sort of evidence. Speaking<a id='r935' /><a href='#f935' class='c012'><sup>[935]</sup></a> of the
songs before Homer, he calls them “quite artless outpourings
of lyrical impulse”; they were “made up of a few simple
words and outcries, constantly repeated, such as we find to-day
among savages.” Again, returning to the dualism of
instinctive and artistic, one may note his happy phrase for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>it when he speaks<a id='r936' /><a href='#f936' class='c012'><sup>[936]</sup></a> of “the change of nature-purpose into
art-purpose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A deeper study of this change, a study of the beginnings
and development of Hellenic poetry, was made in one of the
earlier and saner works of Nietzsche,<a id='r937' /><a href='#f937' class='c012'><sup>[937]</sup></a> written while he was
still in philological harness and before he broke with Wagner.
Art, he thinks, depends on the enduring strife and occasional
reconciliation of two opposing forces which the Greeks embodied
in Dionysos and Apollo. Apollo finds expression in
sculpture, in the individual work of art, Dionysos in the
impersonal art of music; the genius of Greece united these
two in Attic tragedy. Apollo is the personification of that
<i>principium individuationis</i>, the deification of man as artist,
as the solitary boatman whom Schopenhauer imagined<a id='r938' /><a href='#f938' class='c012'><sup>[938]</sup></a>
driven and tossed in this frail bark of individuality upon a
sea of troubles. Now “individual” is as much as to say
bounded, definite, restricted; hence the Hellenic dislike of
exaggeration, its love of artistic reticence and restraint,
and that “Know Thyself” as final word of the god who
is simply a deification of the individual. But there is the
other side. From time to time, say in intoxication, which
has its god in all popular mythologies, or in those great
upheavals of communal emotion due to victory, to love,
to the coming of spring, rises the Dionysian impulse and
shatters all sense of the individual. Such a movement
made the chorus of the Greeks as well as the St. John and
the St. Vitus dances of mediæval Europe. Man the individual,
so Nietzsche puts it in his own dithyrambic style,
sinks back, a prodigal son, into the bosom of that nature
which he has deserted. “By song and dance man shows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>himself a member of the higher unity; he forgets how to
walk, to talk; he is on the way, dancing and leaping as he
goes, fairly to fly aloft. His gestures tell of the magic which
holds him.... <i>He is no longer artist, he is art</i>,”—and all
this in the communal, Dionysian frenzy, the folk as a whole,
and the individual lost in the throng. <i>Turba fit mens.</i> Here
in spontaneous song, dance, gesture, of the crowd is the
opposite of that reticent, deliberative Apollinian art; “this
demonic folksong” is set over against the “artist of Apollo,
chanting psalms to his harp.”<a id='r939' /><a href='#f939' class='c012'><sup>[939]</sup></a> The Greek dramatic
chorus, Nietzsche goes on to say, is simply the old
Dionysian throng, once transformed by their spontaneous
excitement into satyrs,<a id='r940' /><a href='#f940' class='c012'><sup>[940]</sup></a> pure nature and instinct, now conventionalized
and brought under artistic control; the separation
of chorus and spectators is artificial, for at bottom there
is no difference between them, and all make a single body
of dancing and singing satyrs,—that is, the greater part
of the throng now dance by deputy.<a id='r941' /><a href='#f941' class='c012'><sup>[941]</sup></a> We are absurdly
narrow, he thinks, in applying modern ideas of authorship to
primitive conditions. “Dionysian ecstasy,”—and Nietzsche’s
fantastic style<a id='r942' /><a href='#f942' class='c012'><sup>[942]</sup></a> should not hide the soundness of his idea,—“Dionysian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>ecstasy can give to a whole throng this artistic
power of seeing itself ringed about by a host of spiritual
forms with which it feels itself essentially one.” This
passing into another character on the part of a throng,
homogeneous of course and instinctive, is the beginning
of the drama, and differs from the work of the rhapsodist.
“All other choral lyric of the Greeks,” says Nietzsche, “is
only the Apollinian solitary singer intensified; but in the
dithyramb there stands before us a community of unconscious
actors<a id='r943' /><a href='#f943' class='c012'><sup>[943]</sup></a> who see one another as transformed.” The drama,
in short, came from the union of a Dionysian spontaneous,
communal song, in itself chaotic outburst of passion, and the
ordering, restraining, artistic, deliberative spirit which breathed
order into this chaos and is known as the spirit of Apollo.
Thinking on the functions of this artistic, Apollinian spirit,
one is reminded of De Vigny’s definition of art, as “la verité
choisie”<a id='r944' /><a href='#f944' class='c012'><sup>[944]</sup></a>; while it is clear that in the cadences of his verse,
and in the emotion that surges through it, the poet is still a part
of that Dionysian throng. In a word, the Apollinian process,
which is the only process one now connects with one’s idea
of art, or of poetry, intellectualizes and therefore individualizes
emotion. An instructive essay by Dr. Krejči<a id='r945' /><a href='#f945' class='c012'><sup>[945]</sup></a> regards
the fundamental dualism of poetry as a contrast between the
involuntary or mechanical element, and the element of logical
or voluntary creation. As we follow back the course of poetry,
he asserts, the voluntary and creative element decreases,
while there is a steady gain in the automatic, the mechanical,
and the spontaneous,—a gain which is made still more
probable by Bücher’s theory of rhythm. If one could see
the conditions and hear the songs of a primitive time, one
would find poetry, so Krejči makes bold to assert, entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>swayed by the unreflective, mechanical, and spontaneous element.<a id='r946' /><a href='#f946' class='c012'><sup>[946]</sup></a>
In this sense, Apollo is thought mastering emotion,
art in control of that spontaneous, chaotic, and yet rhythmic
expression of the Dionysian throng.</p>

<p class='c013'>Instinctive and spontaneous expression, then, is to be
assumed for primitive song; but the communal idea involves
something more. It demands a homogeneous body of people.
Again tradition points this way, as in the case of
rhythm and of the dualism between nature and art; again,
as before, voices are raised in protest; again M. Tarde is in
the field with a formula directly opposed to the formula of
tradition; and again we must turn to modern science for
some definite answer, only to find it fairly in favour of tradition
and backed in this respect by ample evidence from ethnology
and literature. Modern psychology, it seems, leaves
one free to conceive a throng of primitive men so homogeneous
that a common emotion would call out a common and
simultaneous expression. Thoughts diverge, and thought, or
purpose, controls modern art as it controls modern emotion;
but primitive folk did little thinking, if one may here trust
ethnology and the savage, backed by the controlling evolutionary
facts of literature.<a id='r947' /><a href='#f947' class='c012'><sup>[947]</sup></a> Savage thinking is limited to the
few objects of the savage world, and any effort beyond this
is painful; the wild man complains of headache the moment
he is forced to “think.” Deliberation implies memory, and
purpose regards future complications; but we saw that the
Botocudos have no legends, and we know how accurately care
for future needs marks progress in culture; barring those
ancestral shadows, as with Eskimos, it is true of all savages
that they have no history at all. So utterly disappears our
sharp individual thinking as one touches savage life. Herodotus
was surprised to find a tribe “that had no name”; but,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>as Schultze notes, Bushmen now do not know one another
by any individual appellation. The language of all savage
tribes reflects this lack of individual thinking in our sense;
and it is to tribal emotion, instincts of tribal life and their
social expression, that one always looks for what must pass
as the intellectual life of the savage. The individual savages
do not think, but they feel; and feelings, unlike thoughts,
tend to converge. Nor, again, a most important point, is the
communal elation of the primitive throng to be confused with
the imitation of a modern crowd, yielding, after individual
mental suicide, to the suggestions of a leader who does the
thinking while the crowd acts out his thought. Ethnology
records the fact, but few if any scholars have noted its significance,
that savages are formidable and command civilized
respect in proportion as they act in mass and as a unit, while
modern man is contemptible in the mass; modern man is
formidable as an individual, while the individual savage is
little better than an idiot. Detached from the throng in which
and by which he thinks, feels, acts, he is a silent, stolid fellow,
into whose silence romantic folk like Châteaubriand and
Cooper have read vast philosophies, and from whose forced
conversation, uncentred and mobile as a child’s, missionaries
have drawn most of their conflicting and suspicious statements
about savage myths, customs, beliefs, and ways of
thought. Evidence about savages in the mass, about their
communal life, on the other hand, is nearly all straightforward
and consistent. Hence a conclusion of vast reach and
meaning for the beginnings of poetry: just as individuals are
superior now, just as the mob, the masses, the <i>profanum volgus</i>,
what not, are objects of contempt in these latter days,<a id='r948' /><a href='#f948' class='c012'><sup>[948]</sup></a> so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>this mob, these masses, were far and away superior to individuals
in conditions of primitive life and at the start of social
progress. By the very terms of the case, and in the struggle
for existence, social man was forced to win the early fight
by social consent, and this was the overwhelming fact to
which all individual considerations had to yield. This superiority
attached, of course, to what the mass did and said and
sang as compared with individual utterance. Human nature
remains unchanged, but human conditions are always changing.
One must not treat primitive man, with regard to the
conditions and outcome of his life, in terms of modern man.
The mob, the masses, exist for us mainly as the raw material
of social and political factions. Lack of bread, of work, or
the infringement of fancied rights, leads to a common and
intense emotion, the first requisite of mass movement; a
leader of some sort, with a plan which comes of more or less
thinking, sways the mob to a definite act. But the behaviour
of a mob, the doing and expression of a mob, are now in sharp
antithesis to that doing and expression of individual men
at the bidding of individual thought, of deliberation, plan, and
definite purpose. Conditions of primitive life, so all evidence
goes to prove, reversed this order; and it is a totally evil
process when one transfers the value of a modern mass of
men to the communal throng, the horde, if one will, which
began our social progress. Hence the error in Tarde’s ingenious
argument.<a id='r949' /><a href='#f949' class='c012'><sup>[949]</sup></a> Attacking the idea that a mass of men
ever created language, he conceives the mass in terms of a
mob, language in terms of our highly intellectualized and
individualized speech; and he applies the same impossible
test to religion and to poetry. Who, he cries, “ever saw a
masterpiece of art ... planned and wrought out by the collective
inspiration of ten or a hundred poets or artists?”
None of us, certainly, save in some form of survival hard to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>recognize, has seen such a thing. Primitive man, on the
other hand, knew nothing of a poetical masterpiece in M.
Tarde’s sense. When communal “inspiration” was dominant,
when the throng absorbed the individual, when thought hardly
dared to show its solitary visage before a solid communal
emotion, the masterpiece of art, that is, of individual planning,
hardly had a place; under modern conditions of individual
thinking, communal emotion is just as unproductive in the
æsthetic realm. The masterpiece waited for the master; and
one remembers M. Tarde’s delusion about the origins of all
poetry in some “great book.” In stating his case for the artist,
which is perfectly true for modern conditions, he is really
stating the case, by implication, for primitive communal song.</p>

<p class='c013'>But was this throng really homogeneous? Are the facts
in accord with this theory of communal conditions and the
outcome of them? Mr. Spencer, as every one knows, laid
down the law that all social progress is from the homogeneous
to the heterogeneous;<a id='r950' /><a href='#f950' class='c012'><sup>[950]</sup></a> and M. Brunetière has
adopted this principle as a guide to the study of literary
development,<a id='r951' /><a href='#f951' class='c012'><sup>[951]</sup></a> regarding it as the one doctrine of evolution,
held by Spencer as by Haeckel, which stands the test of
criticism and is beyond the reach of doubt. The history of
culture, so M. le Bon thinks,<a id='r952' /><a href='#f952' class='c012'><sup>[952]</sup></a> points the same way; “counter
to our dreams of equality, the result of modern civilization
is not to make men more and more equal, but to make them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>more and more different.” Comte assumed that the common
trait of biology and sociology is this passing from the whole
to the parts; and although Mr. Spencer, with his doctrine of
cells, has largely set Comte aside, that part of the old system
is intact. Popular books, supposed to sum up the best
results of science, are to the same effect. In primitive
times, says Reclus,<a id='r953' /><a href='#f953' class='c012'><sup>[953]</sup></a> “all felt, thought, and acted in concert.
Everything leads us to believe that at the outset collectivism
was at its maximum and individualism at its minimum. The
individual,” he declares, “was not the father of society;
society was the mother of the individual.” Studies of prehistoric
man, as in the stone age, point to a sameness of
individuals now quite impossible to imagine.<a id='r954' /><a href='#f954' class='c012'><sup>[954]</sup></a> Hennequin is
not with Tarde on this point; the primitive community was
homogeneous, and its members “were all nearly exactly
alike in body and in mind.”<a id='r955' /><a href='#f955' class='c012'><sup>[955]</sup></a> Gumplowicz is explicit for the
beginning of society in homogeneous hordes.<a id='r956' /><a href='#f956' class='c012'><sup>[956]</sup></a> A recent
writer who has made a study of the horde and the family in
primitive development,<a id='r957' /><a href='#f957' class='c012'><sup>[957]</sup></a> and who is by no means of the
extreme school,—he rejects promiscuity, for example,—declares
the horde to have been the starting-point of social
progress. Grosse, casting about for a state of savage life
which shall give the best idea of the life of primitive man,
finds it in a “homogeneous, undifferentiated mass,” thus
backing Spencer at least in his sociological assertion;<a id='r958' /><a href='#f958' class='c012'><sup>[958]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>the best authorities bear out this view. The hordes which
serve, in lack of better ethnological material, as the type of
primitive man, are small and scattered; they have no arts,
no division of labour; individual property is almost unknown,
and the one piece of property, their hunting-ground, belongs
to all the adult males in common. As little difference of
rank exists as of property; seldom are there any leaders, and
where, in a few cases, these are found, their authority is
pitifully small. The only individuals who break this “homogeneous
and undifferentiated” monotony are the supposed
possessors of a magical power.<a id='r959' /><a href='#f959' class='c012'><sup>[959]</sup></a> So runs the certainly unprejudiced
account of Grosse. Even by Sir Henry Maine’s
extreme patriarchal views, the family itself, the first social
group, was a homogeneous and undifferentiated mass in
those characteristics with which the student of poetry must
deal. Mr. Tylor’s group of Caribs,<a id='r960' /><a href='#f960' class='c012'><sup>[960]</sup></a> with uniformity of
physical and mental structure, amply bears out the communal
and homogeneous argument for earliest song; but
perhaps the shortest way with dissenters is a passage by
Waitz,<a id='r961' /><a href='#f961' class='c012'><sup>[961]</sup></a> where he sums up the evidence for this uniformity
of the individuals in a horde and in social groups of a low
order. All their relations of life, he says, are simple, and
are bent in one direction, the procuring of food; there is a
maximum of instinct and common appetite, and almost no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>stir of mind such as follows the division of labour; and this
uniform mental habit works upon the outward person, so
that, physically as well as intellectually, the single man fails
to stand out from the mass. Waitz, who quotes Humboldt
to the same purpose, thus explains why the Romans, with
their complicated civilization, found the Germans all looking
alike, all of one type.<a id='r962' /><a href='#f962' class='c012'><sup>[962]</sup></a> Wherever the horde is visible, even
in a comparatively civilized case, as with the Scottish clans,
there the resemblance of individuals, the emphasis of a type,
is unmistakable; and it is precisely under these conditions
that we find the survivals of communal song. Primitive
man, moreover, dependent on the nature about him, and
acting in his horde like other creatures in the face of a
power which they fear, surrounded himself with a like horde
of spirits,<a id='r963' /><a href='#f963' class='c012'><sup>[963]</sup></a> themselves as little differentiated or distinguished
in any way as the human horde which conceived them.
Even under the highest civilization such conditions of the
horde survive in communal worship. True, the informing
power of Christianity is its individualism, its “flight of the
one to the One”; but the litany, the general confession, the
spirit of congregational worship, are suggestive not so much
of the “O God, I” as of the “O Spirits, We,”—homage once
paid by all the living souls to all the souls of the dead,
and still lingering as a shadowy survival in two great festivals
of the church. Religious emotion is still the strongest
communal element in modern times, particularly when it
takes the form of a great revival.</p>

<p class='c013'>Against all this in general and Mr. Spencer’s theory in
particular, M. Tarde, as was noted, set up his theory of the
infinitesimal and the cell; against the narrower idea of
differentiation in poetry,—epic, lyric, and dramatic regarded
as developments from an earlier compact form in which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>three were still united,—Professor Grosse,<a id='r964' /><a href='#f964' class='c012'><sup>[964]</sup></a> who was so bold
in his assertion of homogeneous life, asserts heterogeneous
poetry from the beginning. Yet he presently lays down<a id='r965' /><a href='#f965' class='c012'><sup>[965]</sup></a> the
larger truth, which carries with it a confusion of his own
particular denial on poetic grounds. “In the lowest stage of
culture,” he says, “art appears, at least for us, simply and
only as a social phenomenon.... In the higher stages,
however, along with the influence which art exerts upon
social life, there comes more and more into view the value
of art for the development of individual life.... <i>Between
the individual and the social function of art is a deep
antithesis.</i>” In other words, he proves by his admirably
selected facts, throughout the whole book, that the art of
primitive times was mainly social, whereas the art of modern
times is mainly individual. Moreover, he is very sure that
primitive society was homogeneous. The inference is inevitable.
Dr. Wallaschek, we saw, set down the “collectiveness
of amusement” as main characteristic of primitive life. These
things cannot be said in one breath, only to be followed in
another by such amazing contradictions as the implication of
Grosse<a id='r966' /><a href='#f966' class='c012'><sup>[966]</sup></a> that the egoist in man is the first of poets, or the
jaunty talk of Scherer about primitive poets and their public,
their royalties, their authorship, when only a few pages away
he tells us that “mass poetry,” poetry of the throng, is the
differencing element in primitive æsthetic life. Posnett, to
whom all students of poetry are under deep obligations for
his vigorous sketch of comparative literature, does justice to
the communal element in early song and reduces the individual,
heterogeneous element to a minimum; his formula
for poetic development is “the progressive deepening and
widening of personality.”<a id='r967' /><a href='#f967' class='c012'><sup>[967]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>It is to be conceded that a superficial view reverses this
order of progress. What does one meet oftener in history
and song,—</p>

<p class='c013'>than talk of a “heroic” age in the remote past, and of the
commonplace, average-ridden present, the epoch, as Le Bon
calls it, of crowds? Against the mediocrity, the hustings, the
juries, the lynching-bees, the “suffrage of the plough,” the
dead level of uninteresting masses, there floats up a vision of
the knight on his quest, of the solitary hero at odds, like Hercules,
with divinity itself, of the good old king who sits to judge
his people in the gates. Have not we moderns the homogeneous
mass, and was not the individual a child of the early
world? Wilhelm von Humboldt<a id='r969' /><a href='#f969' class='c012'><sup>[969]</sup></a> finds the secret of Homer
in his “sense of individuality” and “individualizing impulse.”
Haym, a careful writer, talks of the individualism of the
Middle Ages as opposed to modern times. Blémont<a id='r970' /><a href='#f970' class='c012'><sup>[970]</sup></a> admits
that democracy is individualism, but contends that it makes
for anything rather than for individuality, and simply levels
human life; the mind ceases to be free, and men act in
masses, simplify everything, make life monotonous. Against
this, however, one needs only to recall that quotation just
made from Le Bon: the process seems to be toward sameness,
but is really toward diversity. Men may dress alike,
may show concerted action, may discourage the unusual and
set up a god of averages; but the individual is stronger than
ever before, and he does more thinking for himself. Men
move in masses, true; but it is less and less the herd instinct
and more and more the voluntary coherence of thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>minds. Instinct has yielded to thought. The history of civilization
is the making and unmaking of communities; society
means more than it ever meant; but this is not denying
the fundamental law of progress from homogeneous to heterogeneous,
from communal to individual and artistic. One
must not juggle with these terms. It is true that an army, a
group of men for any purpose, which marches as one man,
is the end and not the beginning of communal effort. It is
true that the savage is notoriously fitful; there is anything
but splendid purpose in his eyes; combined action, under
certain conditions—that is, conditions of civilization—is difficult
even for members of one tribe; their prevailing force
seems to be individual and centrifugal; the bond that binds
them to the community often seems slight beyond belief; as
to their feelings, just now assumed to be almost a unit,
“emotional variability” is the report of many a traveller.<a id='r971' /><a href='#f971' class='c012'><sup>[971]</sup></a>
This has been extended to primitive life, and to the moral
side of the case; early man, says Pulszky,<a id='r972' /><a href='#f972' class='c012'><sup>[972]</sup></a> was ruled by
“unqualified selfishness,” and asserted “his individuality in
every respect.” The same author speaks of “a gradation,
the first word of which is selfishness, and the last, public sentiment.”
Where in all this coil of caprice and incoherence is
the homogeneous community expressing a common emotion
by a common utterance? The answer is clear enough. Escape
from this caprice, this incoherence, this centrifugal
force, is found primarily in social consent, in the communal
utterance which began the long struggle against purely selfish
ends; and communal utterance begins, as has been
shown, in the consent of rhythm. Strong as the selfish
impulses were, so strong the need for at least an incipient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>check upon them in social action; and from social action and
utterance sprang all those altruistic virtues which Pulszky
lauds—patriotism, piety, duty to kin and to the race. The
end of society is to take brute man and make him a civilized
man, to let “the ape and tiger” in him die; man when nearest
ape and tiger, at the beginning of social union, was individually
brutish, stolid, selfish, idiotic, fitful, in a word, individually
bad; and just so far as he submitted to social consent,
lived for the horde, the clan, kin, country, so far he was
socially good. Hence it is easy to see that in this homogeneous
society all the beginnings of civilization, art, poetry,
religion, would be overwhelmingly homogeneous, social, communal;
the condition of their existence was the abnegation
of the individual man in favour of the social man. In a
word, society itself began in this social consent, and since it
had such tremendous forces of selfishness arrayed against it
in the primitive individual instincts,<a id='r973' /><a href='#f973' class='c012'><sup>[973]</sup></a> the only way in which
it could make its way was by utter suppression of the individual
in so far as he was a party to the social bond itself.
Hence a contradiction that is only apparent. The savage as
a creature of animal instinct is as capricious and centrifugal as
one will; as a creature of social act, emotion, thought, he has
no individuality, and puts none into his expression; for it was
precisely this tuition of social consent which little by little gave
him the impulse to deed, feeling, deliberation, as member of
society. Here is the solution of the problem. Arab boatmen
who can not pull ropes in unison,<a id='r974' /><a href='#f974' class='c012'><sup>[974]</sup></a> sing and dance
together with a consent that astonishes the traveller. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>are capricious, fitful individuals in regard to the new kind of
work, but compact, communal society in regard to the festal
consent which united their wandering hordes thousands of
years ago. Descriptions of the savage state easily bear out
this contradiction and this solution, if one will analyze the
facts; and this is why one finds Spencer and Grosse asserting
on one page the homogeneity and collectiveness of savage
communities, and on another page the heterogeneous, capricious,
individual, selfish traits of the savage himself. In
literature we do not so clearly see both sides. Throng-poetry
is rarely recorded; one merely describes a village or
tribal chorus,—and takes down the individual song. Luckily,
however, the “collective character” of primitive amusement
is made as certain as such things can be, by the ethnological
evidence considered in the chapter on rhythm, by the
evidence of popular survivals collected in the chapter on
communal song and dance, and by the evolutionary curves of
poetry itself. Considering all this evidence, one escapes the
snare laid in one’s path by the idea of individualism in the
savage. That “emotional variability”<a id='r975' /><a href='#f975' class='c012'><sup>[975]</sup></a> is individual indeed,
and disappears precisely as the communal expression of
emotion comes into play. It has been proved, too, that, like
speech, rhythmic utterance and rhythm itself in the sense
which Bücher gives to it, are not so much the outcome as
the occasion of social union. The sense of this union, “the
consciousness of kind” as Professor Giddings calls it, is at
bottom a sense of order, and the “instinct for order” is best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>expressed in rhythm; rhythm, it was seen, is not invention
and imitation, but discovery and consent. Anterior to any
process of invention and imitation, which is a social act, must
be the condition which makes this act possible,—a consciousness
of kind and a social consent. Instinctive emotions of a
homogeneous horde felt in common on a great occasion
gave birth to a common expression in which the separate individuals
discovered this social consent. Invention and imitation,
begun as early as one will after this social consent, gave
them the conditions of their activity; but they must not
be put before it, nor, for considerable stretches of social
development, could they be said to have an important place,
since they grew with the growing importance of the individual
in society. If one may dogmatize on the matter, one
may think of three gradations in social progress. First, there
is the consent due mainly to external suggestion working on
instinctive movements: in the dance it is due to that festive joy
of victory and that “rhythmic beating” outward, that rhythmic
impulse inward, which Donovan describes; and in labour,
as Bücher thinks of it, it is either the consent of a solitary
labourer with the labour itself, or, more often, the consent of
several labourers with those instinctive and necessary movements.
Vocal and significant cries went with the movements
in each case. Secondly, but contemporary with the other,
one may figure a less festal occasion and a more active personal
agency; five or six men marching abreast fall into step
and find the labour of marching is lightened,—not a very
different matter from the dance, but less communal and more
unrestrained. Imitation comes slightly into play, but it is
wholly subordinate to consent. Thirdly, imitation and invention
get their rights where the individual discovers or invents
an isolated act, in various degrees of artistic and social significance,
from the jump over an obstacle by the leader in a
row of men marching in Indian file, the sheep-over-a-fence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>process, as Mr. Lloyd Morgan calls it, up to the clever throwing
of a spear, the tying together of two vine branches, the fashioning
of a spear-head, which are invention outright, triumph
of individual thinking, plan and deliberation detached from
communal emotion. The leader is on hand; the “headless”
hordes have heads. Spontaneity, instinct, the automatic,
still dominant in communal dance and song, in reminiscential
rites of every sort, have yielded in active life to thought and
purpose of the individual, to division of labour, to that power
to plan a protracted piece of work and carry it out in detail
which makes for progress. But before this formula of invention
and imitation can apply, before one talks of the leader
and the led, there must be a coherent body which can resolve
itself into these relations of parts; and precisely here is the
beginning of society in social consent, and here, too, the
beginning of poetry in communal and rhythmic utterance.</p>

<p class='c013'>One thus faces a seeming paradox in the conception of
poetry as at once the highest expression of the differentiated,
deliberate, artistic individual, and, at the same time, the fullest
expression of a homogeneous, spontaneous, automatic mass;
the paradox vanishes at once if one will only see in rhythm
consent and emotional cadence of a dancing, singing multitude,
and in artistic phrase and thought the deliberate control
and plan of the individual,—Apollo in the foreground, and
the background filled with a festal Dionysian throng. Why
refuse to see this social background, or, in another figure,
this communal foundation of poetry? Guyau puts beyond
doubt the essentially social character of the art, even under
modern conditions; but one makes a phrase, and returns to
the old way. A long succession of deliverances on solitary
genius has befogged the critical vision and blotted this lode-star
of social conditions from the sky. In other fields such
a mistake is unknown. The student of political science
would never deny that a representative in Congress, as his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>name implies, is the deputy of a throng that once, say in the
forests of Germany, would have come together as a compact
legislative body and settled questions of state. But in
poetry the poet ends and the poet began, a creature of solitude,
now in commerce with the immensities and infinities,
and now holding out his hat to the public for a <i>honorarium</i>,—the
public’s only part in the poetic process. If the public is
brought in, it is to explain the poet, as with Sainte-Beuve and
Taine, or to explain the gentle reader, as with Hennequin.
Poetry is a whisper, a confidence, to this gentle reader.
When the throng, not to speak of the silence about its active
functions in poetry, catches up a poem that it likes, and
roars it, as it roared Mr. Kipling’s <i>Absent-minded Beggar</i>,
over all England, this is very salt in the wounds of the critic,
who declares, with some justice, that here is no “poetry” at
all; while the same author’s <i>Recessional</i>, with its individual
appeal, its recoil from popular sentiment, its assertion of
thought over emotion, is set down, and rightly, as “poetry of
a high order.” Judging poetry by the standard of modern
conditions, which are wholly individual, artistic, intellectual,
the critic is right. The war-song of to-day, all lyrics of the
throng, have a hollow and unreal ring in them; even Tennyson’s
<i>Light Brigade</i> somehow gives the effect of armour
which is laced with bonnet-strings. The real song of war
in an age of communal poetry was heard at that moment
which Müllenhoff calls the supreme moment of all Germanic
life, when the images of the gods were brought out, when the
wedge was formed,—leaders of battle at the thin forward end
and women and children in the rear,—the whole community
at hand; with the hurling of Woden’s spear, all swept into
the fight, chanting the great chorus of war. Here is the folk
communal in organization to great extent, but not quite homogeneous;
not a leaderless horde, but still holding to elements
of that primitive life; here is still poetry of the people.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>Communal elation still furnishes the main cause of poetic
utterance; the utterance is immediate; and development of
the individual has not yet sundered the making and the
hearing of a song.<a id='r976' /><a href='#f976' class='c012'><sup>[976]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>That primitive horde with its uncouth but rhythmic dance,
its well timed but seemingly futile song, has now, let us
hope, found its justification as the source of poetry. Not like
the dance and song among Botocudos and Veddahs, a thing
of degeneration or at least of sterile and unpromising kind,
was this beginning of the beginnings; rather a feat of vast
moment for the coming race of men, an achievement not to
be measured by ordinary phrase. In the long reaches of
growth and differentiation which stretch from this beginning
to the present time, we are now to take our steps forward;
the backward mutters of dissevering power which sought to
resolve poetry unto its communal elements must now yield
to a record of its progress; and our first task is to catch
sight of the poet, the master of his art, as he detaches himself
from the throng and sets out upon that path which leads
him to his present state of grace. Another and an interesting
question concerns the waning communal element, how
it loses its hold upon poetical production, and how far it still
modifies the poet’s work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Where and how, then, does the poet appear? Coöperation,
however unlike what one now understands by coöperation,
was the beginning of social progress, and the discovery
or perception of rhythm had to play the main part in this
first communal act whether of work or of play. Rhythm
is the expression of a sense of coherence; and the first coherence
was of a kind to suppress the individual: all evidence
goes to show this fact. The Veddahs live mainly in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>isolated pairs, a brutish existence, except when some great
tribal interest brings them together; at such a time that
monotonous, leaderless dance about the arrow, man clasped
close to man in an almost solid ring,—the Botocudos, too,
and many other tribes, are pictured as thus forming a fairly
compact mass, with only a part of the individual body free to
move in unison with the same part of every other body,—is
the way by which the clan or horde finds itself in this unwonted
relation. Then the individual detaches himself from
his singing with the throng, and for a verse or so sings to the
throng; but how tentative, how momentary his effort, and
how short his range away from the repeated communal
chorus! For this individual is not acting as individual,
acting freely in isolated life, but as member of a body which
is just beginning to be a body and to understand its power
of social and therefore of mutual influence. Moreover, as
Spencer points out, primitive imagination is purely reminiscent,
not constructive; the earliest working of what may pass
as poetical imagination, then, is an individual utterance
reminiscent of communal utterance and prolonging it with
shy and tentative variations. This is precisely what one
finds in the song of Veddahs and Botocudos. In the
Eskimo singing-house the soloist has come to greater importance;
he sings always a song of his own making, while the
women join in the chorus “<i>amna aya</i>, the never failing end
of each verse.” In this singing-house “almost every great
success in hunting is celebrated ... and especially the
capture of a whale.” When the soloist is not singing these
adventures, or satiric songs, also great favorites, the flyting
or song-duel is in order.<a id='r977' /><a href='#f977' class='c012'><sup>[977]</sup></a> Great, however, as the independence
of the singer seems compared with a bard of the
Botocudos, the chorus is still imperious, and no one singer
is eminent. Everybody sings,—not only in chorus, but in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>his turn as soloist; and everybody makes his own song.
How utterly alien to this conception of early social life is
the monarchical idea, the great man idea, human history
begun by the tyrant of a submissive band! Take a half
civilized state of society, as among the Germans described
by Tacitus; here it is evident that democracy prevailed in
peace, while in war, with concessions to men of “royal”
blood, the strongest and boldest men acted as chieftains
gathered in the thin end of the wedge, going into battle as
exemplars and leaders, but not as generals, not as commanding,
overseeing genius of a deliberate plan. As with
government and war, so with property. Grosse<a id='r978' /><a href='#f978' class='c012'><sup>[978]</sup></a> notes in
those tribes that approach primitive ways few marks of individual
ownership, but a mass of marks which denote claims
of the horde or clan. So, too, with language, a problem
which nobody in these days is fain to undertake;<a id='r979' /><a href='#f979' class='c012'><sup>[979]</sup></a> but
surely the mystic style of Donovan’s article must not hide
the soundness of his views,<a id='r980' /><a href='#f980' class='c012'><sup>[980]</sup></a> already noted, on the festal
origin of human speech. Religion, however, may have
offered an earlier chance for centrifugal forces. It is probable
that the medicine man, the shaman, with his visions,
his abnormal states and doings, closely connected with that
perilous stuff which every man of the horde had upon his
individual heart in ordinary dreams, furnished the earliest
example of a commanding personality acting in such an
eccentric way as to make sharpest contrast with the coherence
of communal action. Here, said the community,
here is a man with a “gift,” a man apart; and his use of
wild dance and song in exorcism may have begun at a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>early date. Later, too, something of the sacred and the
mysterious inherent in a shaman’s vocation may have been
transferred to the poet; priest and singer alike came to refer
their ecstasy to a divine source. Yet magical ceremonies,
whatever the advocates of prose-poetry may say, offer no
good opportunity to observe the actual beginnings of the poet.
We can see him detaching himself, not as magician or in
special rites, but as a simple singer and dancer, from the
singing and dancing throng; and this is the proper point
of departure in our study, for the good reason that here is a
fissiparous birth. Offspring of the communal chant by the
simplest process, his own chant merely continues that of
the community, which for an instant or so turns silent and
passive for his profit. Again, this first of singers is no artist
in verse, favourite of the muses, no man apart, son of the
golden clime and solitary wanderer over Parnassus; he is
every member of the throng in turn. To prove this vital
point, we must not only take ethnological evidence, here conclusive
as well as abundant, but must also follow that method
which has led to some good results in foregoing pages of
this book; we must try to connect the evidence of savage life
with those survivals in an advanced stage of culture which by
their mere survival indicate the persistence of a habit rooted
deep in human history and human nature. We must study by
this double light a few facts in regard to that improvisation
in which Aristotle found the beginning of poetic art.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fissiparous birth of individual from communal poetry is
confirmed by the process observed everywhere among savage
tribes. Solitary performance has come there to a considerable
pitch of skill, but it yields always in importance to the
chorus, and along with profit and reputation of a sort it often
involves a kind of shame. Prostitutes do the individual
singing and dancing in many parts of the Orient;<a id='r981' /><a href='#f981' class='c012'><sup>[981]</sup></a> singing-women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>and dance-girls, even in advanced stages of culture,
pay dearly for their eminence; and something of this decline
in caste clings to the most respectable solitary performances,
now and here, of the skilled “entertainer.” The mimes of
the Middle Ages were often held to be without the pale, not
only of the law, but of the church itself;<a id='r982' /><a href='#f982' class='c012'><sup>[982]</sup></a> and while other
causes worked to this end, something must be conceded to
that attitude of every public to its entertainer or even teacher,—extravagant
praise and delight, extravagant rewards, but
with it all a sense of aloofness, an inclination to wave away
this centrifugal element which has set itself over against the
communal body, now an indulgent contempt, where mere
pastime is concerned, and now dislike and distrust at an
exhibition of independent thought.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been repeatedly shown that short improvisations are
the earliest form of individual poetic art, and are sung in the
intervals of a chorus, or to relieve the monotony of labour,
where again they detach themselves from the parent refrain,
modify it, add to it, and so build up a song. There is no
need to dwell on the evidence for savage improvisation. The
African is amazing in his power to turn an event into verse;
it is a communal affair for the most part, with a chorus in the
background. At public dances the Indians of America
improvise, man for man, indefinitely, leaning also on the
monotonous refrain. Throughout the South-Sea Islands<a id='r983' /><a href='#f983' class='c012'><sup>[983]</sup></a>
improvisation of songs is as common as speech; even the
children improvise. The lower the level of culture, the
more general this gift of improvising; “among the Andamans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>every one composes songs.”<a id='r984' /><a href='#f984' class='c012'><sup>[984]</sup></a> The same holds of
Australia, of far Siberia, and throughout the savage world;
moreover in all these cases the habit is not solitary but festal.
The oldest poetry known to tradition among the Afghans
was improvised in reply to an insulting verse;<a id='r985' /><a href='#f985' class='c012'><sup>[985]</sup></a> but the
professional singer is on hand, and improvisation has become
an art. The history of poetry among civilized races always
shows a surplus of improvisation in the initial stage known to
the records; so it is with the Greek <i>skolion</i>, as well as with
dramatic beginnings; and so, to take a different case, with
the Arabs, where improvisation long held almost absolute
sway,<a id='r986' /><a href='#f986' class='c012'><sup>[986]</sup></a> although drama had no place and a subjective spirit
reaches back to the earliest tradition. Again, where a literature
is undeveloped, although under civilized conditions,
improvisation is the main force; in this case are the Basques.<a id='r987' /><a href='#f987' class='c012'><sup>[987]</sup></a>
In fine, it is not a vain tradition which puts a general gift of
improvising verse before the development of any national
literature; and Plutarch, in his treatises on Music and on
the Pythian Oracle, speaking of a time when all formal
utterance was in poetry, and when even men without poetic
fire were wont to make verses on any subject, is telling not a
fable but something very close to truth. The proof is
not far to seek, and comes from ethnological as well as
literary sources.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>Improvisation in this early and general sense, however,
must be distinguished from the later sort which was purely
professional, an art which Schlegel<a id='r988' /><a href='#f988' class='c012'><sup>[988]</sup></a> calls “poetic rope-dancing”
and sunders from the older and nobler gift, from
“natural and partly amœbean, extemporaneous poetry, which
was and still is a source of social entertainment.” The drama,
he notes, began in this way.<a id='r989' /><a href='#f989' class='c012'><sup>[989]</sup></a> As a social gift, indeed,
improvisation lingers long with civilized folk; a hundred
years ago the poet was ready with his “impromptu on seeing
Miss —— asleep in the moonlight;” and games were common
enough where every one had to make verse. Lady
Luxborough<a id='r990' /><a href='#f990' class='c012'><sup>[990]</sup></a> wrote to Shenstone: “It is the fashion for
everybody to write a couplet to the same tune—an old
country dance—upon whatever subject occurs to them.”
The couplets, it would seem, were satiric; and here, of
course, is a late stage of the flyting. Then there was the
clever man of society, like Theodore Hook,<a id='r991' /><a href='#f991' class='c012'><sup>[991]</sup></a> who would
improvise you verses on anything; but this phase of the art
is best studied in Italy. It is to be noted that such verses
were generally sung;<a id='r992' /><a href='#f992' class='c012'><sup>[992]</sup></a> and, indeed, they come close to the
professional improvisation which is to be considered below.
For the present we are to look at the older and more communal
stage, where art is just putting on a show of independence
and learning to walk alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>The question is not of the fact of improvisation in primitive
stages of culture, familiar to every student in this field,
but of the manner in which improvisation begins, grows,
hardens into a profession, and dies out in vain rivalry with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>song of a more deliberate art. A mass of improvised verse
could be quoted which differs from the refrain and chorus
of the throng only in respect of a trifling variation in
language and a trifling addition to the matter. Leaving
this fissiparous offspring, we turn to that form of improvisation
which shows an organic structure of its own, and keeps
the refrain at greater distance, discarding, too, the more
persistent forms of repetition. Mungo Park<a id='r993' /><a href='#f993' class='c012'><sup>[993]</sup></a> tells one story
of his African wanderings which may be assumed as a
faithful report of the facts; for it is to be believed, or hoped,
that Park’s pen, unlike the pen of many travellers in general,
and the pen of Mr. Brooke of Middlemarch in particular,
was not “a thinking organ” apt to run into adventures of its
own. The wanderer, wet and tired, was taken into the hut
of a native woman, who gave him food and a mat for bed,
going on with the other women to “spin cotton” most of
the night. “They lightened their labour<a id='r994' /><a href='#f994' class='c012'><sup>[994]</sup></a> by songs, one of
which was composed <i>extempore</i>,” says Park, “for I was
myself the subject of it. It was sung by one of the young
women, the rest joining in a sort of chorus.... The words,
literally translated, were these: ‘The winds roared and the
rains fell; the poor white man, faint and weary, came and
sat under our tree,—he has no mother to bring him milk;
no wife to grind his corn. <i>Chorus</i>: Let us pity the white
man; no mother has he,’ etc.” Here the young woman
seems to lead the chorus and suggest its words, while in the
more primitive type of improvisation it is the chorus which
supplies the main theme, and the tentative, momentary singer
only adds his flourish. Here, too, is the element of the
<i>honorarium</i>; for Park was so affected that he gave his landlady
“two of the four brass buttons which remained” on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>his waistcoat, and surely the poetess could claim one of
them for her poetry. We have all read far worse at far
higher rates. True, the chorus or refrain is still very potent;
the little contemporary event is the sole suggestion of verse
which looks neither before nor after; but the incremental
factor is less hampered and less timid, and a touch of reflection
and sentiment—provided this was not the product of
Park’s reminiscent mood—is at hand in the sympathy for
a motherless man.<a id='r995' /><a href='#f995' class='c012'><sup>[995]</sup></a> Australians, too, though lower in the
scale than Africans, make songs on the spur of the moment
which “refer to something that has struck the attention at
the time,” and add a bit of reflection. Actually subjective
and reflective poetry among such people, now and then
reported by missionaries,<a id='r996' /><a href='#f996' class='c012'><sup>[996]</sup></a> may be rejected with confidence
as either mistaken in the hearing or else as echoed from
hymns or pious stories told to an excessively imitative folk.
It is still the tribe, clan, horde, for the party of the first
part, and an event, an emotion, affecting this body as a
whole, for the party of the second part, which gets into the
communal verse even when sung by a single deputy. Individual
emotion as a thing for itself is nowhere in the case.
Indeed, if there were time for it, a raid upon philological
ground would show a tendency to avoid the first and second
person singular in all primitive speech; surely that observation
of Schleicher<a id='r997' /><a href='#f997' class='c012'><sup>[997]</sup></a> is not antiquated, along with his other
theories, when he says that the varying stems of the personal
pronoun point at a deliberate process aimed to avoid
expression, “as indeed often in language one finds a shyness
to use the <i>I</i> and the <i>thou</i>.” Romanes,<a id='r998' /><a href='#f998' class='c012'><sup>[998]</sup></a> too, notes that “in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>earliest stages of articulate utterance pronominal elements,
and even predicative words, were used in the impersonal
manner which belongs to a hitherto undeveloped form of
self-consciousness.” Perhaps this belated individual expression
came into poetry in the guise of robust satire, which at
first clannish and collective, like the songs of the maids
about Bannockburn, like the mutual satire of rival villages
even now, like the mocking songs sung by African girls at
a dance, passed into the particular mood as a kind of flyting.
An excellent survival of this clan-satire turned upon an
individual member occurs some hundred years ago. Pastor
Lyngbye,<a id='r999' /><a href='#f999' class='c012'><sup>[999]</sup></a> long a resident among the Faroe islanders, tells,
without the faintest desire to advance a critical theory,
precisely how a ballad was made in a throng and under circumstances
which were primitive in every respect save the
accident of date. The whole community meets on even
terms to spend a few hours in sport. The expression of
communal feeling is first and foremost the dance; and to this
dance, as was once the universal custom, they sing their own
songs. Now the song may be one about Sigurd or other
hero of yore; and in this case one can determine, so far as
possible, whether the “common fund or patrimony” of race
tradition furnishes the theme or whether the story is borrowed
from abroad. But the song is not always about
Sigurd; and Lyngbye’s simple story of one which is local,
spontaneous, communal, should be taken to heart by comparative
literary accountants. Some fisherman has had a
misadventure, whether by his fault or his fate, and comes
to the public dance. Stalwart comrades seize him, push
him to the front, and before the whole community dancing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>and swaying to a traditional rhythm, stanza after stanza is
improvised and sung, first by a few, then in hilarious repetition
by the throng; and so, verse by verse, the story of the
accident “sings itself,” with the hero dancing willy-nilly to
the tale of his own doings. Now, adds Lyngbye, if this
ballad takes the fancy of the people, it becomes a permanent
thing, repeated from year to year. Here, indeed, is what
may well pass as “objective” poetry;<a id='r1000' /><a href='#f1000' class='c012'><sup>[1000]</sup></a> an absolute antithesis
to the subjective and reflective poetry with which modern
conditions of authorship have made us so familiar that we
ignore the fact of any other kind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Similar makings and traditions of the improvised song of
satire come from the Highlands; witness the words of J. F.
Campbell.<a id='r1001' /><a href='#f1001' class='c012'><sup>[1001]</sup></a> “It was quite a custom in the Highlands, and
that not long ago, to meet for the purpose of composing
verses. These were often satirical, and any one who happened
not to be popular was fixed upon for a subject.
Each was to contribute his stanza, and whoever failed to do
his part was fined. Whenever a verse happened to be composed
that was pretty smooth and smart, it took well ...
and spread far and wide.” Campbell notes the corresponding
habit of Icelanders, as told in the <i>Njalssaga</i>. All
this is still fissiparous offspring of the festal dance and
song; but just as all mankind now loves a lover, so in more
robust days it may be assumed that all mankind most loved
a fight; and the fight in alternate stanzas of a song-duel
concentrated attention on the fighting pair, spurred them to
independent effort, and brought about an organic, individual
song. This flyting is a venerable affair; and every one
knows the dual combats in verse so common among the
Eskimo, a pretty makeweight to amœbean verse under the
Sicilian skies. In Iceland not only were sarcastic verses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>made upon one another by professed poets like Gunnlaug
Snake-Tongue, but at the dance <i>mansöngvar</i>, that is, satiric
stanzas exchanged by men and women, were in vogue for
every one, and in their Fescennine license often called out
futile protest from the church.<a id='r1002' /><a href='#f1002' class='c012'><sup>[1002]</sup></a> Civilized Europe itself is
covered from end to end by traces of a custom once, it
would seem, universal among folk of low and high degree;
and it is beyond doubt, save with theorists who decline
to look at the evidence of comparative literature, that amœbean
verse of the classic kind, rude dramatic beginnings,
survivals like the <i>strambotto</i> and <i>stornello</i> of Italy, the <i>coplas</i><a id='r1003' /><a href='#f1003' class='c012'><sup>[1003]</sup></a>
of Spain, the <i>stev</i> of Norway, the <i>gaytas</i> of Galicia, the
<i>schnaderhüpfl</i> of Germany, all go along with these rough
flytings of half-civilized and of wholly barbarous races as
offshoots of communal song where the individual singer
detaches himself from the chorus and sings stanzas which
mainly incline to rivalry with another singer. Moreover,
this was once a universal gift. Wherever communal conditions
survive, there survive also traces of a time when one
could talk of a “folk in verse” as well as of a folk in arms.
Improvisation is a fairly easy process with Esthonians,
Lithuanians, Finns, where classic tradition is out of the
question, just as it is an easy process with the peasant of
Italy. The substitution of love for hate or satire, of frank
erotic stanzas of the times when the way of a man with a
maid was matter of communal interest, is easy to understand,
if hard to date and place; even now, rustic love-making at
picnics is conspicuous for epithets that might easily be
understood as belonging to a quarrel. The publicity of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>amatorious stanzas still survives in games and country revel.
A game now played among the young people of Swedish
Finland, “Simon i Sälle,” was described by a native to the
present writer; in a dancing ring of both sexes, with
chorus and refrain, a youth steps up to a girl and says he
has something to give her. What has he, is the more or
less defiant question; and he must improvise his stanza
descriptive of the gift, while all the other young men continue
dancing forward and backward as he sings, the girls
standing. When a girl has to improvise, the other girls
dance and the young men stand still.<a id='r1004' /><a href='#f1004' class='c012'><sup>[1004]</sup></a> This universal improvising
power must be put in the clearest possible light, in
order to show that the formula of exceptional bucolic wit,
rustic bard, simple but noted singer of the countryside, as
offset to the polished singer of a better time and place,
is utterly inadequate to explain the beginnings, growth, and
decline of what is called popular poetry. Communal labour,
of course, echoes in these improvisations as well as communal
satire and love. Until recent days, people in the Scottish
Highlands gathered at a farmer’s door on the first night of
the year, singing a few lines in Gaelic, while one of their
number dragged a cowhide and the rest beat time with
sticks; in this fashion they marched three times round the
house. Then all “halt at the door, <i>and each person utters an
extempore rhyme</i>, extolling the hospitality of the landlord.”<a id='r1005' /><a href='#f1005' class='c012'><sup>[1005]</sup></a>
Workmen in Dunkirk<a id='r1006' /><a href='#f1006' class='c012'><sup>[1006]</sup></a> still improvise verses to a favourite
tune, singing the chorus with great energy:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ali, alo, pour Maschero!</div>
      <div class='line'>Ali, ali, alo,—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and in solo, improvised then and there, a line such as,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Il boit le vin et nous donn’ de l’eau,—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>with another choral “ali, ali, alo.” In fact, when one comes
to a certain class of peasant life, improvisation is as universal
a “gift” as it is among the savages, and as it was by general
consent of ethnologists<a id='r1007' /><a href='#f1007' class='c012'><sup>[1007]</sup></a> among all primitive folk. For a
glimpse at the past, Cædmon is evidently a case of improvisation—it
was expected of the merest hind, one sees—lifted
to literary performance. When Anglo-Saxon laws<a id='r1008' /><a href='#f1008' class='c012'><sup>[1008]</sup></a> say a
priest must not get drunk and “turn gleeman or ale-bard,”
they mean that he is not to improvise convivial songs, and
they have no reference to the professional minstrel; he is to
resist a common temptation and refuse a traditional duty of
every reveller, much like the duty of the Greek to make and
sing his <i>skolion</i> at the banquet. So, again, it is inversion
and perversion of the plain facts when one thinks of Welsh
<i>pennillion</i> as scattered brands from the old Eistedfodd fire;
it is the growth of a professional class of bards out of the
general turn for improvising which is to explain the Eistedfodd,
and it is the survival of old and universal habit when
Welshmen even now sing one <i>pennill</i> after another in rapid
alternation. Professor Schuchardt<a id='r1009' /><a href='#f1009' class='c012'><sup>[1009]</sup></a> heard such a friendly
contest not long ago, and was struck by the close resemblance
of these quatrains to the German <i>schnaderhüpfl</i> and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>improvised stanzas of Italy. Improvisation is the first step
and not the last step in art; theories that the ballad is a belated
bit of art taken up by countryfolk after the lords of
letters have flung it aside,<a id='r1010' /><a href='#f1010' class='c012'><sup>[1010]</sup></a> that songs of the people echo old
opera tunes and concert ditties, and all easy little <i>dicta</i> of the
sort, are confuted by a study of comparative literature both
in the genetic and in the sociological phases of it. Peasants
who make verse-combats their source of entertainment might
be regarded as imitating a troubadour <i>débat</i>, if one did not consider
how universal and primitive a custom this is known to
be. Eskimo song-duels are not borrowed from the troubadours.
Italian peasants might be said to derive their <i>strambotti</i>
from amœbean verse like that of Vergil, were it not for
the fact that Roman peasants loved and practised this sort of
thing from the beginning. As Horace says, speaking of the
old breed of Roman,<a id='r1011' /><a href='#f1011' class='c012'><sup>[1011]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c013'>/#

#/</p>

<p class='c013'>a festal and communal affair. This rustic communal interchange
of satire in improvised verses works up to the level of
art not at first by aid of the poets, but by singers of note,
men who began to take a pride in their special gift of improvisation,
as will be shown in the following pages. Meanwhile
a specimen of the verse-contest under partly communal
conditions can be found in an Irish <i>carmen amoebacum</i>, as Mr.
Hyde calls it, improvised alternately by a guest and his hostess.
The latter has the hard end to carry, as she must finish
the quatrain which the man begins; and no wonder she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>yields, especially as the Blarney Stone has evidently lent aid
to her gallant visitor.<a id='r1012' /><a href='#f1012' class='c012'><sup>[1012]</sup></a> It is clear, then, that idyll and eclogue
in degeneration are not to explain the verse-combats whether
of savages or even of peasants; the Roman and Oscan farmers
improvised such songs in their <i>satura</i> and in their rough
comedies, innocent of all literary influences; and the Italian
peasant of to-day keeps up this custom wherever schoolmasters
and other plagues of civilization bide afar off and leave
him to his own communal devices. What Theocritus<a id='r1013' /><a href='#f1013' class='c012'><sup>[1013]</sup></a> and
Vergil did was to use these rude improvisations as suggestion
or even foundation for their art.<a id='r1014' /><a href='#f1014' class='c012'><sup>[1014]</sup></a> For rustic survivals these
<i>strambotti</i> and the <i>coplas</i> of Spain, with other quatrains of
the sort, made in and for the dance throughout the length
and breadth of southern Europe,<a id='r1015' /><a href='#f1015' class='c012'><sup>[1015]</sup></a> are less useful for purposes
of study in primitive song than the <i>schnaderhüpfl</i> and the
<i>stev</i>, one German, the other Scandinavian, of northern lands.
As to the former, J. A. Schmeller’s brief account,<a id='r1016' /><a href='#f1016' class='c012'><sup>[1016]</sup></a> made
sixty years ago, is still authoritative, though much has been
written about these quatrains since; most readable as well as
most learned is the essay of Gustav Meyer.<a id='r1017' /><a href='#f1017' class='c012'><sup>[1017]</sup></a> Collections and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>discussions<a id='r1018' /><a href='#f1018' class='c012'><sup>[1018]</sup></a> are plentiful; and it is to be noted that the name
of this sort of verse is not constant, being now disguised as
“songlet,” “dancer,” and the like, and now as <i>rundâ</i>.<a id='r1019' /><a href='#f1019' class='c012'><sup>[1019]</sup></a> Schmeller
defines the <i>schnaderhüpfl</i> as “a short song consisting of one
or two riming couplets, <i>but in any case of four lines</i>, which is
sung to certain local and traditional dance-tunes, and is often
improvised on the spot by the singer or dancer.” Singer <i>and</i>
dancer, of course, is the primitive form, and this as hendiadys:
“the singing dancer.” A typical quatrain of the sort,
so far as this consideration goes, comes from Vogtland:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I and my Hans,</div>
      <div class='line'>We go to the dance;</div>
      <div class='line'>And if no one will dance,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dance I and my Hans.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Hinterhuber<a id='r1020' /><a href='#f1020' class='c012'><sup>[1020]</sup></a> describes the modern process; the waltz goes
on awhile, then in a pause the throng sings a few stanzas,
then the dance is resumed and youth after youth improvises,
without ceasing, to a traditional tune. “<i>They never sing
the verses of local and popular poets, but all is original.</i>”
What is of particular interest in this process is the communal
scene and occasion, mainly a village dance, the traditional
tune, the frequent chorus, and, against this background,
the individual performance of the singer. We seem to find
here the point of departure for artistic poetry; for in the
actual quatrain one seldom meets repetition, that inevitable
note of the refrain and of the fissiparous single song which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>detaches itself, as among savages, from the refrain; and while
the reapers’ song may be behind all this rude lyric of the
hills, it is no festal recapitulation of communal labour, no
echo of work or village triumph, that one hears, but rather
the personal sentiment, either erotic or defiant, of the individual
singer. Moreover it is always from one person and
mainly to one person. Nevertheless, it must have dance,
throng, communal conditions through and through, or it is
not the <i>schnaderhüpfl</i>. So interesting a case as this excuses
some breadth and detail in the treatment of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The home of the <i>schnaderhüpfl</i> is centred in the Bavarian
Alps, spreading thence in many directions and to some remote
districts, which may all be found described in the careful summary
of Gustav Meyer; the concern now is not with the
vogue but with the thing itself. It is slowly degenerating
and even disappearing, in spite of its tenacity, its vigour, and
the love for it felt by the peasants of those conservative
regions. As with the rural refrain, so here, lewd fellows of
the baser sort lay hold upon it as the communal and universal
character of it lapses; near Weimar one may still hear peasants
singing these quatrains in a kind of emulation, but the frankly
erotic has become licentiously rotten. Here and there, however,
it lives in its old estate, but by a very feeble tenure;
singing societies, friends from the city, concert tunes, what
not, are hounding it from its last retreats. The quatrains now
gathered are mainly traditional, not freshly improvised like
those of earlier days, and it is interesting to note how many
variants can be found of one theme. Direct borrowing
occurs, of course; but a more frequent process is the use of
a popular initial line which is continued in varying fashion
into a corresponding variety of verses. Something like this,
but not really the same thing, is or was common in cheap
theatrical exhibitions, where some catching but meaningless
refrain introduces a series of local “hits.” The <i>schnaderhüpfl</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>however, has a far more dignified way, reflecting a
nobler mood whether of joy or of grief. Thus a pair of quatrains,
perhaps amœbean in origin, from near Salzburg:<a id='r1021' /><a href='#f1021' class='c012'><sup>[1021]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When it’s cold in the winter,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And snow-tempests whirl,</div>
      <div class='line'>How cozy and warm</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In the room of my girl!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When it’s cold in the winter,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Go warm you a while;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the love that is old</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Cannot easily spoil.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Close to the amœbean, and with two lines essentially the
same, are these,<a id='r1022' /><a href='#f1022' class='c012'><sup>[1022]</sup></a> in mild satire:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No mountain so high<a id='r1023' /><a href='#f1023' class='c012'><sup>[1023]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line in2'>But the chamois can pass,</div>
      <div class='line'>And no youngster on earth</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Can be true to his lass.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No mountain so high</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But the chamois climbs over,</div>
      <div class='line'>And no girl is so fair</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But she’ll take to a lover.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This is improvisation on crutches. Often, however, the
standing line has variations; for example:<a id='r1024' /><a href='#f1024' class='c012'><sup>[1024]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>And no heart in the world</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But beats for some one.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But we are nearing the “keepsake” and “annual” tone;
it is well to hold the dance in plain sight and hearing, where
one gets either the mood of Eros:<a id='r1025' /><a href='#f1025' class='c012'><sup>[1025]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O sweetheart, be wiser,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dance with no tailor,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Dance only with me,</div>
      <div class='line'>And my love is for thee!—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>or the mood of Anteros:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I thought you were pretty;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It’s false, I declare;</div>
      <div class='line'>You’re goitred and crooked,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A girl with red hair,—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>one specimen out of many, but quite sufficient, for that lyrical
exchange of compliments at the dance which has satisfied the
sense of humour in rustic and even savage communities everywhere;
a nearer echo, even, of the dance, in the spirit of the
Miller of the Dee, is in this quatrain:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I’ve a cow and a calf</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And a donkey, all three;</div>
      <div class='line'>And what do I care</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Who the leader<a id='r1026' /><a href='#f1026' class='c012'><sup>[1026]</sup></a> may be?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>So the dancing youth, at Innsbrück, flinging his money to the
musicians for a good turn, likes to proclaim to the throng his
own self, not forgetting his guild:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>What needs has a hunter?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A hunter has none,</div>
      <div class='line'>Save a girl with black eyes,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And a dog, and a gun.<a id='r1027' /><a href='#f1027' class='c012'><sup>[1027]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Or a girl proclaims her lover’s prowess:<a id='r1028' /><a href='#f1028' class='c012'><sup>[1028]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>My lover’s a rider,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A rider is he;</div>
      <div class='line'>His horse is the kaiser’s,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The rider’s for me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>So, too, the rude compliment:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You girl with the black eyes</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And chestnut-brown hair,</div>
      <div class='line'>When you look at me so,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I turn fool, I declare.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Easy and silly, one says. Precisely. Easy because made
by everybody and still close to the repeated refrain of the
throng, and silly in the old meaning of simple and plain.
All the great lyric poets know that they must be silly in
this sense, or they are mere ink and paper, divorced from
life and the lilt of communal song; Goethe, Burns, Heine,
will tell that tale plainly enough, and let one compare Matthew
Arnold’s <i>Geist’s Grave</i>, not to speak of Wordsworth’s and
Landor’s triumphs, with the genuine pathos but irritating
intricacy of T. E. Brown’s <i>Aber Stations</i>. Perhaps this bit
from Salzburg<a id='r1029' /><a href='#f1029' class='c012'><sup>[1029]</sup></a> shows the improvisation, still simple to a
fault, working up to the note which one demanded for real
poetry:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>My heart is a clock,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And it stops now and then;</div>
      <div class='line'>But a kiss from my lassie</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Can start it again!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>Or with a little pressure on the form, with hint of art, this
from Steiermark:<a id='r1030' /><a href='#f1030' class='c012'><sup>[1030]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You are fair, you are dear,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But you are not my own;</div>
      <div class='line'>You’d be fairer yet, dearer yet,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Were you my own!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Familiar as a source of quatrains is the youth pleading or
querulous outside of the fair one’s window, and the maid
doubtful or scornful within; there are a few English fragments
of this sort which are printed in Chappell,<a id='r1031' /><a href='#f1031' class='c012'><sup>[1031]</sup></a> and some
are still heard in the rural parts. The Salzburg youth pleads
thus:<a id='r1032' /><a href='#f1032' class='c012'><sup>[1032]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ah, love, lift the latch,—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Here the wind is so bleak;</div>
      <div class='line'>With thee in the house there</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How cozy and sweet!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>From this, with hundreds of the sort, runs a lyrical path, if
one could but trace it, to the elaborate ode of Horace,<a id='r1033' /><a href='#f1033' class='c012'><sup>[1033]</sup></a> imitated,
of course, from the Greek, and its type long become
the conventional treatment of an unconventional situation,
but no doubt at the start expanded from shorter and more
vivid songs of “the excluded lover,” of which one finds a
scrap in the other and more famous ode on the courtesan’s
old age:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Audis minus et minus iam</div>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Me tuo longas pereunte noctes,</i></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>One has heard the Salzburg youth; and the Salzburg maid is
explicit in her reply:<a id='r1035' /><a href='#f1035' class='c012'><sup>[1035]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>Go away from my window,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And leave me alone;</div>
      <div class='line'>The door I’ll not open</div>
      <div class='line in2'>However you moan,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>a striking contrast to the complacency of a <i>schnaderhüpfl</i>,
said to be one of the oldest recorded, taken down by Tobler
at Appenzell, in 1754:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Mine, mine, mine, O my love is fine,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And to-night he shall come to me;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the clock strikes eight, till the clock strikes nine,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>My door shall open be.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But one must stay by the dancing throng, the rivalry of the
singers, the question and answer, a succession of stanzas thus
tending to group about a theme given by the occasion and
kept in mind by a constant suggestion of rime and repeated
or slightly varied verses; from all this it is highly probable
that one will learn something of the communal origins of
lyric poetry. Thus there is nothing immediate or suggestive
of the dance in a detached quatrain with question and answer
like this:<a id='r1036' /><a href='#f1036' class='c012'><sup>[1036]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Why crying, my pretty,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>By the tree there alone?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why should I not cry</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When my sweetheart is gone?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But the dance and the throng are not far away from saucy
bits of another type:<a id='r1037' /><a href='#f1037' class='c012'><sup>[1037]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Black-eyed and bright one,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were I not the right one</div>
      <div class='line'>For you of them all ...</div>
      <div class='line'>If I loved you at all?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Or this:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You lass with the black eye,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now leave me alone;</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m not your Darby,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And you’re not my Joan.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>Similarly there comes from Carinthia a challenge of youth
to youth, with audible lilt of the dance, too often prelude to a
grim struggle not in Touchstone’s version of the code, but
based on Touchstone’s theory of “mine own”:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>You will not, you will not my lassie be loving,</div>

      <div class='line'>You’ll have to, you’ll have to go find you another,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>You know well, you know well my lass is for me!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>What now is to prevent these quatrains, whether in question
and answer, or in a succession of related and varied
harpings on one theme, to form a little poem, a lyric?
Professor Brandl says it does not so happen, as if solitude
and paper and emotion at second hand always had to be in
the case; facts, however, say that the process is not only
probable in theory but definitely before one on the record.
To begin with, a quatrain of undoubted communal origin, a
genuine <i>schnaderhüpfl</i>, often finds its way into a folksong;
so with this from Alsace:<a id='r1038' /><a href='#f1038' class='c012'><sup>[1038]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>’Tis not so long ago it rained,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The trees are dripping yet;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I had, I had a lover once,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I would I had him yet.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is a pretty little English ballad called <i>The Unquiet
Grave</i>,<a id='r1039' /><a href='#f1039' class='c012'><sup>[1039]</sup></a> which begins in the same tone:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The wind doth blow to-day, my love,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And a few small drops of rain;</div>
      <div class='line'>I never had but one true-love,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In cold grave she was lain....</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and the ballad goes on with a dialogue between the lover
and his dead sweetheart.<a id='r1040' /><a href='#f1040' class='c012'><sup>[1040]</sup></a> On the other hand, amœbean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>forms of the <i>schnaderhüpfl</i> could easily lead to such alternate
stanzas as one finds in the pretty ballad, common in France,
to which Child supplies “a base-born” English cousin, <i>The
Twa Magicians</i>,<a id='r1041' /><a href='#f1041' class='c012'><sup>[1041]</sup></a> with a catching refrain suggestive of the
dance. So plain is the connection between these <i>schnaderhüpfl</i>,
the <i>stev</i> of Norway, all similar isolated quatrains,
and the actual songs of situation, question, and answer, that
Landstad declared for the quatrains as <i>débris</i> of longer
poems. But Gustav Meyer<a id='r1042' /><a href='#f1042' class='c012'><sup>[1042]</sup></a> is surely right in his energetic
rejection of this way of looking at the process; his proof
seems convincing to a degree. Nobody will say that the
artistic lyric as we have it, or even the later communal ballad,
is made by direct union of scattered stanzas; but it seems
clear enough that these isolated quatrains furnish the material
for such poems, and that part of the process could be
achieved in the grouping of quatrains improvised about a common
subject and on a communal occasion. Those repeated
questions why the forsaken lass is crying, still echo in a lyric
like Scott’s <i>Jock of Hazeldean</i>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Why weep ye by the tide, lady,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Why weep ye by the tide?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and it is demonstrable that improvised quatrains give a
situation, and so group themselves into a little poem;
Meyer<a id='r1043' /><a href='#f1043' class='c012'><sup>[1043]</sup></a> quotes such a song of two stanzas which has been

Eichendorff or some poet of the sort:—</p>

<p class='c013'>A little more circumstance, a touch of nature, a touch or
two of art, and out of the question and answer in improvised
quatrains comes a ballad, with the help of that
neglected but so unjustly neglected refrain, for which notice
has been demanded already as for an important communal
element in poetry. So one might guess the origins of the
pretty ballad of the sickle:<a id='r1045' /><a href='#f1045' class='c012'><sup>[1045]</sup></a> given a traditional refrain of

<p class='c013'>No stress, of course, is to be laid on this particular case,
which simply serves to show how unquestioned improvisation
of quatrains on one of the little tragedies common
in rural life could be combined with the traditional refrain
of a reapers’ dance, and so pass into popular lyric.</p>

<p class='c013'>Often this making of a lyric calls in the aid of repetition,
and an iterated line serves as thread to tie the quatrains together;
such poems have been noted already,<a id='r1046' /><a href='#f1046' class='c012'><sup>[1046]</sup></a> and were
called more or less artificial. But they certainly suggest
now and then the improvisation of quatrains at the dance,
and belong there originally; a clear case may be given from
Steiermark.<a id='r1047' /><a href='#f1047' class='c012'><sup>[1047]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>Gustav Meyer has followed this combination of quatrains
into a popular song,<a id='r1049' /><a href='#f1049' class='c012'><sup>[1049]</sup></a> perhaps sprung from improvised collaboration,
or else rivalry, at the dance, with a pretty but
cynical stanza added in the process of oral tradition,—itself
a quatrain heard singly in Tyrol, while the others, also
sung separately, seem to be of Swabian origin. The song
may follow as a farewell to these <i>schnaderhüpfl</i>, now rapidly

<p class='c013'>“The most genuine of all folksongs, and almost the only
kind which is still made,” as E. H. Meyer says of it, this
<i>schnaderhüpfl</i> is a single strophe of four lines,<a id='r1050' /><a href='#f1050' class='c012'><sup>[1050]</sup></a> complete in
itself, always improvised—though it often becomes traditional—and
always in the native dialect; it is not a fragment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>of some older and longer song, but rather lends itself to
combination into a popular lyric of oral tradition.<a id='r1051' /><a href='#f1051' class='c012'><sup>[1051]</sup></a> Careful
comparison shows that similar quatrains, probably of similar
origin in the dance, occur not only in Welsh, in Italian,
French, and Spanish, in Lithuanian, in Hungarian, in Roumanian,
Greek, Russian, Polish, everywhere in European
speech, but even in Syrian, in Malay, and such distant languages.
It is known in Chinese. Most closely related to it
are the <i>stev</i> of Norway, of which Landstad<a id='r1052' /><a href='#f1052' class='c012'><sup>[1052]</sup></a> gives a small
collection in his book of Norwegian ballads. Granting that
the real <i>stev</i> must be improvisation, he is too quick to connect
them with the old scaldic poetry and with earlier and
longer poems, regarding these quatrains—he hesitates, however,
in stating the case—as wreckage of ancient ballads and
once an effort of the bard. The theory of <i>débris</i>, thus tentatively
asserted, is successfully answered by Gustav Meyer,
as it is by a consideration of the <i>schnaderhüpfl</i> quoted in
these pages; and it fares no better here than it does when
applied to Italian <i>strambotti</i> and the artistic work of Theocritus
and Vergil. Indeed, Landstad’s own account of the
<i>stev</i> confutes his theory about them. Making these quatrains,
he says,<a id='r1053' /><a href='#f1053' class='c012'><sup>[1053]</sup></a> was once a universal social custom, and lingers
even yet.<a id='r1054' /><a href='#f1054' class='c012'><sup>[1054]</sup></a> His picture of the peasants gathered for a winter
evening’s amusement, guests and especially the older people
sitting at tables which run along the walls, men at one end,
women at another, while the young people dance in the middle
of the room; the “drinking” staves sung as the ale cups
go round, where women often answer to rough but jolly
quatrains from the other end of the tables, and where every
person must sing his stave; the rude compliments and vivacities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>of the dance: all this points to a survival of primitive
custom. Traditional verses often serve to open the contest
nowadays, but improvisation begins with the personal combat,
and the fun grows fast. These older staves have a
standing refrain for the second and fourth lines of the
quatrain;<a id='r1055' /><a href='#f1055' class='c012'><sup>[1055]</sup></a> but the modern kind are like the <i>schnaderhüpfl</i>
and are improvised throughout. A touch of “sentiment and
reflection” is not unusual; for example:<a id='r1056' /><a href='#f1056' class='c012'><sup>[1056]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I know where to look for my bridal mirth,—</div>
      <div class='line'>In a coffin black deep down in the earth;</div>
      <div class='line'>I know where my bride-bed soon shall stand,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Deep in the earth in the grit and sand.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Verse of this sort points to the improvisations already treated
in part under the <i>vocero</i><a id='r1057' /><a href='#f1057' class='c012'><sup>[1057]</sup></a> and to the songs which go with
refrains of labour, not so much the swift and jovial verses of
flax-beaters and other workers in bands, as the often tender
and melancholy songs of women grinding at the mill.<a id='r1058' /><a href='#f1058' class='c012'><sup>[1058]</sup></a> But
enough has been said and quoted to show that improvisation,
as it detaches itself from communal refrains, tends to be
individual, sentimental, reflective, and so artistic and lyrical
in the modern sense. The quatrain sung by youth to maiden
in the dance is still communal in its connotation; detached,
it smacks less and less of the public occasion, tries a deeper
note of sentiment, has more and more of the reflective and
confidential; so one can come to the mingling of passion
and art in an ode of Sappho, in a lyric of Burns. Moreover,
parallel with this change of quality, runs a process of grouping
into songs. The scattered traditional stanzas, once
improvised as isolated quatrains, gather at first in pairs,—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>prevailing type is question and answer,—to which a
stanza or two is added explanatory of the situation and the
season, often with that refrain which is recognized as belonging
with the original occasion; and this is the communal
lyric, or, as it is called in a stricter use of the term, folksong.
Henceforth, the difference between a folksong and a
lyric is mainly between oral, traditional origin and the
deliberate and artistic composition of recorded literature.</p>

<p class='c013'>This study of the beginnings of lyric has dealt mainly with
sentiment, hostile or erotic, as expression of an individual,
slowly detaching itself from expression and interests of the
clan. But reflection, another note of what passes now for
lyric poetry,<a id='r1059' /><a href='#f1059' class='c012'><sup>[1059]</sup></a> the element of thought, comes into poetic
expression just as sentiment comes, and seems to be of equal
date. As the individual erotic song may go back to the concerted
dances, cries, gestures, of a whole horde, at periods of
sexual excitement which were probably once of uniform occurrence,
so the reflective note of a lyric poem could be
traced to early communal thinking. “Communal thinking”
is perhaps a vile phrase; comment on doings and interests
of the horde, as distinguished from those chanted verses
merely descriptive of the event or fact, ought to be less open
to objection. As a feat of primitive epic, the statement of
what the horde has just accomplished, whether in hunting or
in war, has been found to be a constant element in the songs
sung by savages to their communal dance; while gesture,
shout, recapitulation in cadenced movement, of the same feat,
has the dramatic note. Now it is well known that little sentences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>detached from the story or acting of the event, but
suggested by it, belonging to it, are often sung by these same
savages, now in chorus, and now in individual improvisation.
“Good hunting to-day!” sang the Botocudos; which is a
very different matter from particular recapitulation of the
hunt, as in a buffalo-dance or the like. These sentences,
like gnomic poetry at large, are of most ancient date;<a id='r1060' /><a href='#f1060' class='c012'><sup>[1060]</sup></a> but it
is clear that they soon passed under control of the acute
thinker, and shunned the fellowship of choral song:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Einsam zu denken,—das ist weise;</div>
      <div class='line'>Einsam zu singen,—das ist dumm.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is also clear that this element of thought and meditation
would help very materially the change from a sung to a
recited verse, and hasten, wherever it could act upon poetry,
the disintegration of communal song. Of course, an alliance
with sentiment was inevitable; the acute thinker deserted
verse for prose and science, and with the lapse of communal
singing and the rise of solitary reading, lyric came to mean
three things: a subconscious harmony of rhythm, legacy of
the consenting throng; sentiment, as the expression of
individuality, fostered by this confidence between solitary
poet and solitary reader; and reflection, which is now the
comment of the individual on the doings of the world as a
whole, on the burden and the mystery, that final horror,
expressed by Leconte de Lisle, at the idea of unending
human woe,—</p>

      <div class='line'>Le long rugissement de la vie éternelle.<a id='r1061' /><a href='#f1061' class='c012'><sup>[1061]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>This at one end of the chain, and the Botocudos’ choral
reflection, “Good hunting to-day!” at the other; a link midway,
perhaps, is the half individual, half choral expression of
pity which those African women put into their song about
Mungo Park, and dwelt upon in their refrain.</p>

<p class='c013'>So much for the beginnings of modern lyric poetry, as an
individual and artistic expression, compared with the lyric of
a communal dance, the iterated refrain of a throng. “Modern,”
of course, is a relative word; and the whole process
has been hinted rather than described. Holding fast, however,
to the facts of earliest and rudest improvisation among
savages, holding fast to the facts of universal improvisation
as observed among European peasants, and to the making of
single songs out of groups of these improvised stanzas, we
are warranted in asserting that the process is one from communal
to individual conditions, and begins on a level of general,
if not equal, ability to make and sing verse, preferably
in the form of a single couplet or quatrain, which is at first
subordinate to the chorus of the throng, then meets it on
even terms, and at last, losing its general origins and its particular
individuality and coming to be part of an artistic poem,
drives the discredited chorus from the field.</p>

<p class='c013'>As regards epic poetry, the relations of the ballad and the
choral refrain have been studied in preceding pages. This
ballad, or narrative song, holds far more closely than the lyric
to conditions of communal making. It abhors sentiment and
reflection, for it keeps to the impersonal, public path; it is
averse even from the arts of variation save in the form of
incremental repetition, and it clings to the communal refrain
and to the communal dance. For this reason the ballad is
without rival among recent forms of poetry as a field for the
study of surviving communal elements; joined with the materials
of ethnology, it gives the soundest reasons for constructing
that curve of evolution which marks the steady increase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>of lyric, individual, emotional, and reflective characteristics
in poetic progress. With its relations to the epic there is
here no space to deal in any satisfactory way.<a id='r1062' /><a href='#f1062' class='c012'><sup>[1062]</sup></a> The epic,
however, is now conceded by every one to belong to times
which by no means can be confused with the beginnings of
poetry; M. Tarde and his theory that literature begins with
a “great book” like the Bible or the Homeric poems,<a id='r1063' /><a href='#f1063' class='c012'><sup>[1063]</sup></a> can
hardly expect an answer on any serious and scientific ground.
The narrative song or ballad goes back, of course, to that
universal gift of people in low levels of culture, the power
to turn a contemporary event into song, into the rhythm
of the communal dance, as is still done by Samoans and
by nearly all savage tribes. All was momentary in this
initial act. The rhythm was there in cry and beat of foot;
the event was there; and the bridge of articulate words to
connect these two elements was of the shortest and simplest
kind. The variation, the incremental repetition, are obvious
advances; but it is worth while to note that the almost endless
repetition of a verse or two, describing some event or
situation close at hand, is diminished in corresponding ratio
to the growing power of tradition, as if the memory of yesterday’s
poetry, of last year’s poetry, gradually took the place
of this contemporary repetition,—the “stretched metre”
coming in course of time to be the “antique song.” Everywhere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>among savages, when the improvised song at feast
and dance finds favour, it is passed down as part of the traditional
stock. And so one comes to that state of things where,
as Ten Brink has put it so well, song oscillates between production
and reproduction, that is, between improvisation and
memory. This is the period of the early epic. When deliberation
and conscious art come in, and yet the old alliance of
spontaneous production and living memory is not broken up,
then is the golden age of epic verse; then Homer, whoever
or whatever he may be, can work out the perfect union of art
and nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>Turning to the drama, one asks whether improvisation can
also be found in this form of poetry, taking it, as in the case
of epic and lyric, out of communal control into the province
of individual art. Aristotle has answered the question in that
interesting account of Greek drama quoted above; and he has
distinctly affirmed the passage from a communal origin in a
wild chorus through rude improvisations up to the triumphs
of Hellenic tragedy. Nietzsche, in a book also quoted above
at considerable length, has studied this transition as a contrast
of the Dionysian and Apollinian elements of poetry.
Latin drama, of course, is a copy of the Greek; but the
imitations of a foreign and finished model were preceded
among the Romans by rude improvisations at the festivals
of the countryfolk, where anything like copy and importation
must be ruled out of the case.<a id='r1064' /><a href='#f1064' class='c012'><sup>[1064]</sup></a> In Italy this rude improvisation
of comedy lingered later in survivals that were of course
mingled with many literary influences; so too the rough drama
of the fairs in France,<a id='r1065' /><a href='#f1065' class='c012'><sup>[1065]</sup></a> the popular plays in Germany, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>even mysteries and moralities as played by the guilds, retained
much of the old communal character and were long at the
mercy of improvised speeches, however fixed and intricate
the plot and scenes. Many of these survivals—such as the
mummers’ plays—became also fixed in the words, but that
was when the plays had gone to fossil and the custom itself
lingered as by a sort of inertia. Italian comedy for some
time had a dialogue “mainly extemporaneous”;<a id='r1066' /><a href='#f1066' class='c012'><sup>[1066]</sup></a> and as
these plays grew into urban favour, the improvised dialogue
was graced by a higher tone and a more dramatic
purpose, lasting almost into the eighteenth century. The
<i>commedia dell’ arte</i>, in other words, is simply the improvised
play of peasants passing into artistic and professional control,
but still holding to certain communal features.<a id='r1067' /><a href='#f1067' class='c012'><sup>[1067]</sup></a> The realistic
elements of dialect, satire of certain professions, and the like,
point back to the satiric quatrains and songs at the dance;
and the dance is always at hand in farce and low comedy
down to this day. In Spain the <i>coplas</i> took a dramatic
turn; improvised question and answer, with the situation
to fit, easily became a kind of drama, although the records
are by no means full or accurate, and other influences
played a conspicuous part.<a id='r1068' /><a href='#f1068' class='c012'><sup>[1068]</sup></a> The dance and play, described
in <i>Don Quixote</i>,<a id='r1069' /><a href='#f1069' class='c012'><sup>[1069]</sup></a> at Camacho’s wedding, may be a “beautified”
country mask with more or less extemporaneous songs
and dialogue. The main point about these popular plays is
their testimony that the drama passed from communal chorus,—dancing,
song, gesture, and refrain,—by the way of improvisation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>into its new estate of art; even under Elizabeth the
theatre was no stranger to extemporaneous dialogue, and that
pathetic appeal, in which, perhaps, Shakspere more completely
drops his “irony,” his objective mask, than anywhere else,
not only testifies to a nobler conception of the drama, but
to the clinging abuse. It was not the clowns alone who
spoke more than was set down for them; though their
fooling was most hurtful because they made jests offhand
with persons in the audience,<a id='r1070' /><a href='#f1070' class='c012'><sup>[1070]</sup></a> and sang irrelevant
doggerel verse. Some of these verses have perhaps crept
into the text of <i>Lear</i>. Often, however, the jester had
full license to entertain the crowd by a piece long known
as a jig. Tarlton, the famous jester,<a id='r1071' /><a href='#f1071' class='c012'><sup>[1071]</sup></a> “was most celebrated
for his extemporal rhyming and his jigs,” which were a
combination of improvised song and a dance, accompanied
by tabor and pipe. But the jig was also used for songs in
dialogue, with a dramatic leaning; “a proper new Jigg, to
be sung dialogue wise, of a man and woman that would
needs be married,” is preserved among the Roxburghe
Ballads. Amplified a little, the jig was carried across the
water by English comedians, and meeting similar native
forms of more or less extemporaneous verse, with dance
and farce, became the <i>singspiel</i>.<a id='r1072' /><a href='#f1072' class='c012'><sup>[1072]</sup></a> But the improvisation
of one’s lines to fit the “plot” or <i>scenario</i> of far nobler
performance was common on the English stage,<a id='r1073' /><a href='#f1073' class='c012'><sup>[1073]</sup></a> and may
have had Shakspere’s indulgence if not his sympathy;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>Von Stein<a id='r1074' /><a href='#f1074' class='c012'><sup>[1074]</sup></a> goes so far as to say that the formal character
of Shakspere’s dramatic work is “a fixed mimetic improvisation,”—whatever
that may mean. Of the fact, however,
there is no question. Tom Nash, in his <i>Lenten Stuffe</i>,<a id='r1075' /><a href='#f1075' class='c012'><sup>[1075]</sup></a>
telling of the trouble he had from that “imperfit embrion of
my idle houres, the Isle of Dogs,” explains this description
of his play by saying that having “begun but the induction
and first act of it, the other foure acts, without my consent
or the least guesse of my drift or scope, by the players were
supplied,”—a source of mischief for all hands. It was from
Italy that the custom came to improvise even tragic speeches;
and the passages in the <i>Spanish Tragedy</i>,<a id='r1076' /><a href='#f1076' class='c012'><sup>[1076]</sup></a> where Hieronymo
is preparing his play, show what was expected:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Italy, to be sure, may have influenced the habit of improvisation
in formal drama; but the custom is a survival rather
than a growth, and the statement that Sir Thomas More in his
youth—the tradition is preserved also in a tragedy which
bears More’s name as the subject—showed extraordinary
power of improvisation in a play, must not be taken<a id='r1077' /><a href='#f1077' class='c012'><sup>[1077]</sup></a> as indicating
a tendency in Henry VIII’s time which came to be a
widespread habit under Elizabeth. Such skill of improvisation
in plays diminishes as artistic and deliberate drama
comes to the fore. So with the mask. At first a dance,
with songs and improvised dialogue for the maskers, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>offered great opportunities for artistic work; Ben Jonson and
Milton can tell how the process went on, and with what
results.</p>

<p class='c013'>Improvisation in the drama of comparatively modern times
could be followed into remoter places, for example into Persia,
where the comedies are mainly in extemporaneous dialogue.
Even in Tahiti what passes for drama is improvised;<a id='r1078' /><a href='#f1078' class='c012'><sup>[1078]</sup></a>
and all evidence makes for this state of things in the primitive
play. The earliest form of the drama consists mainly of
action and gesture in the dance,<a id='r1079' /><a href='#f1079' class='c012'><sup>[1079]</sup></a> so as to repeat a contemporary
event of communal interest,—war and the chase, or,
with farming folk, and more in reminiscence, the doings of
seedtime and harvest; it is clear that the rude songs and
shouts that went with step and gesture<a id='r1080' /><a href='#f1080' class='c012'><sup>[1080]</sup></a> and mimicry must
have been improvised. In late stages of tribal life, certain
dances and the songs that go with them become absolutely
fixed, a ritual calling for unusual care in the learning of it;
such is the American buffalo dance.<a id='r1081' /><a href='#f1081' class='c012'><sup>[1081]</sup></a> But in the earliest
drama dance, gesture and choral song were the main elements,
and the variation from those repeated shouts took, so
it would seem, the path of short improvised and individual
utterance. Those improvised stanzas, to be sure, which
plagued the frustrated Faroe fisher, dancing perforce to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>own shame before the dancing and singing throng, led to a
narrative song, a ballad, and so in time might lead to an epos;
but in the making of the stanzas, along with mimicry and
dance, there is more of the dramatic than of the epic element.<a id='r1082' /><a href='#f1082' class='c012'><sup>[1082]</sup></a>
The improvised song-duel, of which so much has
been said, is incipient drama; and all those songs sung in
cadence by groups of workers in the wine-press, at reaping,
pulling, even when marching, and rushing into the fight, have
the dramatic trait so far as they go with the appropriate action.
So, too, the festal recapitulation of labour, with its
appropriate songs and movement, would lend itself to dramatic
improvisation more easily and hence earlier than to
narrative; the art of telling a tale, as may be learned from
ethnology as well as from the observation of children’s
games, is an accomplishment which comes much later than
the art of mimicry and rude improvisation at the dance. The
improvising singer and dancer detaches himself from the
throng to give an isolated part of the action,<a id='r1083' /><a href='#f1083' class='c012'><sup>[1083]</sup></a> and may put
it into words to suit his gesture and steps; or two persons
may dance, gesticulate, and sing alternately in what answers
dramatically to the amœbean song,—an actual fight may
have found this kind of recapitulation at a very early stage
of the poetic art. True, as was noted above, Wallaschek
will not allow that this primitive form of drama had anything
to do with poetry; it was pantomime, he says, without words,
like the mimic dances of the Damaras, the Fans, and other
savage tribes. But it is beyond question that rude songs are
often sung along with the acting and the mimicry; and every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>consideration<a id='r1084' /><a href='#f1084' class='c012'><sup>[1084]</sup></a> makes it probable that the pantomime pure
and simple, with distinct repression of the desire to give vent
to the feelings by shout and word and song, is an artistic not
to say artificial development<a id='r1085' /><a href='#f1085' class='c012'><sup>[1085]</sup></a> of the original drama along the
lines of a painful, concentrated imitation, and is almost a professional
affair. Then there is the “speaking pantomime,”
so called.<a id='r1086' /><a href='#f1086' class='c012'><sup>[1086]</sup></a> In short, the communal origin of the drama was
surely where Wagner declared it to be, in a combination of
gesture, dance, and song, the whole man active “from top to
toe,” and also, one may add, active as a member of a thoroughly
and concertedly active throng. Even the animal and
bird dances, favourite among savage tribes, and supposed to
be pure pantomime, have the imitated cries of the model in
time with the dance; and this is a kind of poetry, lingering
in refrains like Walther’s <i>tandaradei</i>. More than this, it is
fairly certain that word and gesture<a id='r1087' /><a href='#f1087' class='c012'><sup>[1087]</sup></a> went together in the
early stages of speech. As Letourneau points out,<a id='r1088' /><a href='#f1088' class='c012'><sup>[1088]</sup></a> the word
was too uncertain to stand by itself, and needed the bodily
movement that went with it;<a id='r1089' /><a href='#f1089' class='c012'><sup>[1089]</sup></a> while the sounds instinctively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>uttered in tune to the cadence of labour and play were
felt to lend force to the dramatic representation and fill out
the mere suggestion of gesture. An artistic series of movements
alone,<a id='r1090' /><a href='#f1090' class='c012'><sup>[1090]</sup></a> an artistic series of words alone, would be a
later triumph; improvisation of new words to the traditional
cadence, and to the given, and in a sense obligatory gestures,
would mark early progress in the making of this primitive
kind of poetry.</p>

<p class='c013'>Drama, then, in the widest sense, is the “imitation” of life
by means of remembered and repeated movements, induced
by the feeling of social elation, and made possible by the
cadence of social consent in the dance, accompanied by sounds
which instinctively follow this cadence of the action and find
their stay as well as their suggestion in the regular recurrence
of rhythm. It must have followed hard upon the discovery of
consent in common step and common cry, which, if one choose,
one may call primitive lyric; the other may pass as primitive
drama. In perspective they seem almost contemporaneous in
origin. The question of priority, debated with so much
warmth, thus becomes a question of names, and not a very
important question at best. It is a matter of differentiation
and growth from a common origin, which may be described as
dramatic or lyric, according as one understands the terms, and
which certainly had both elements in it. It was rhythmic, and
it was an outlet for communal emotion; it was imitated action,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>with momentary and spontaneous suggestions; and it can be
called narrative or epic only by unwarranted stretching of
the words, though the slightly reminiscent factor in the case
may be called an epic germ. Finally, the differentiation and
growth from this communal poetry of a primitive stage of
culture must have been mainly the work of improvisation, or
individual assertion, acting on the communal elements, and
leading to disintegration and new combinations in processes
which varied with the conditions of race and environment.<a id='r1091' /><a href='#f1091' class='c012'><sup>[1091]</sup></a>
One suggestive fact, however, is to be noted. The drama, in
a broad sense, is the beginning of poetry; it is also the end
and perfection of the art, and this by a communal reaction.
There are centripetal as well as centrifugal forces; if the
individual is forever breaking away from the throng and
carrying poetry into lonely paths of deliberation, sentiment,
artistry, the throng, mainly by that subtle suggestion of consent
in rhythm, is forever calling the poet back to his communal
point of departure. We have seen how slowly the
communal beginnings of poetry,—to us like geological
periods, because they have sent down to us no records,
and only a few hints of their existence,—yielded even to
the tentative progress of individual art, and what long ages
must have contented themselves with songs of the horde
and the iteration of the refrain in a tribal dance; it is equally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>true that the communal instinct still summons poetry back
from its hiding-place with the poet in that “ivory tower,”
and bids it tread the ways of open and crowded life. In the
drama poetry may, indeed, find its final form, as Goethe
declared, but it is also coming back in some degree to the
instincts and habit of its prime; it is recalling its forces from
the scattered and lonely paths of individual thought for a
distinctly communal reaction. Even the opera, the ballet,<a id='r1092' /><a href='#f1092' class='c012'><sup>[1092]</sup></a>
though in less marked degree, show this reactionary communal
spirit. The communal elements of action, dance,
music, scene,<a id='r1093' /><a href='#f1093' class='c012'><sup>[1093]</sup></a> all of which Aristotle had reckoned along
with drama and epos as a part of poetry, are thus variously
restored. Narrative is banished in favour of the plot, which
at least seems to be natural action; deliberate lyric effort,
the solitary thought, is rejected for what at least seems to be
improvised or spontaneous speech of the actors; dancing and
festal expression may or may not be present, and so with
music, but the rhythm is deputy for the cadence of dancing
feet; and finally there is what seems to be the real world
of men, the scene. These realistic effects, these chariot-races
and locomotives on the stage, whatever one despises
most heartily in the degenerate drama of the day, are the
reaction from excesses of subjective poetry toward actual
life and the tendency toward communal conditions which
art always shows when it deals with a public and abandons
the confidences of author and reader.<a id='r1094' /><a href='#f1094' class='c012'><sup>[1094]</sup></a> It is perhaps too
much to assert that the drama was done to death through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>excess of that “lyric cry,” and by a tendency which developed
character at the expense of action; but the counter
movement has been toward the mass and rude effects of force.
In the eyes of some uncritical folk, the lack of distinct individual
characters, the effect of a homogeneous mob of
actors, the crude but vigorous course of events, in early histories
and miracle plays, would make better claim to the title
of drama than the subtile characterization of Shakspere and
the humours of Jonson; <i>arma</i>, they might maintain, should
come before <i>virum</i> for the playwright; and if any comfort
can be gathered from our deplorable modern drama, it may
possibly lurk in this idea of the return to communal art. In
any case, it is the price which our age has to pay for the
piercingly subjective character of its lyric poetry. Epic, in
any objective and vital form, has vanished, and the drama,
desperate in its struggle for life, turns to demos as to a long-forgotten
friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before one leaves the beginnings of poetry, its earliest disintegration
in point of treatment and theme, and goes back to
that improvising poet, in order to glance again at the beginnings
of artistry and the decline of communal power, one has two
elements of the main subject with which it is well to come
to terms. Besides the subject-matter of poetry, there is its
style, its form; between the style, or figurative element in
poetry on one hand, and on the other hand, its material divisions
of drama, epos, lyric, is that vast and ill-defined province
assigned to myth. Now claimed as metaphor, and offspring
of earliest language, now as drama of nature, now as the tale
told by primitive fancy in response to primitive curiosity,
now as the lyric or hymn which embodied man’s first religious
impulse, this fugitive and exquisite creature has had as many
masters, has been dragged over as many paths, and has kept
as unimpaired beauty, as that famous daughter of the soudan
of Babylonia, affianced to the king of Garbo. Of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>these temporary masters none is so comprehensive in his gallantry
as A. W. Schlegel,<a id='r1095' /><a href='#f1095' class='c012'><sup>[1095]</sup></a> who hails myth as the source of
poetry, of philosophy even, as the soul of primitive language,
as “nature in poetic robes,” and goes so far as to say that
modern physical science could easily be stated in terms of
ancient mythology. Myth, indeed, is such a wide word with
Schlegel that it covers the romances of Arthur and Charlemagne;<a id='r1096' /><a href='#f1096' class='c012'><sup>[1096]</sup></a>
and when one reflects that folklore has since claimed
its share of mythological territory, while, on the other hand,
brutal folk who speak for a new euphemerism call myth an
impudent baggage with no religion in her and only a touch
or so of poetry, the case is complicated. Over a path so riddled
with pitfalls one is not anxious to walk; but to treat the
beginnings of poetry without touching myth is out of the
question, and a few steps must be made if only to secure
a point of view. We shall consider myth in its relation to
primitive verse, and shall then turn to the kindred topic
of early figurative language and poetical style.</p>

<p class='c013'>Concerning the source and function and meaning of myths<a id='r1097' /><a href='#f1097' class='c012'><sup>[1097]</sup></a>
a long battle has been waged, and noise of it is still ringing
in our ears; but the fiercer struggle seems just now to have
come to a kind of truce, and the warriors, as in that other
contest over the origin of language, appear to be lying on
their arms. The more one knows of early civilization, it
would seem, the less one feels inclined to dogmatize about
the source of myths; while with regard to their meanings,
that exhilarating and harmless pastime, where scholar after
scholar came forward with his solution, where Bacon in older
days turned classic myth into the wisdom of the ancients, and
where, in later times, Simrock gave a <i>haec fabula docet</i> for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>every shred of Germanic fancy and fable;<a id='r1098' /><a href='#f1098' class='c012'><sup>[1098]</sup></a> where Uhland,
in his beautiful book on the Myth of Thor, blew one of the
most exquisite and iridescent bubbles that ever delighted
the poetic eye and broke at the touch of common sense;
where Max Müller and his friends converted the primitive
Aryan now into a fellow of the prettiest and most fanciful
habit of mind, with his interest in sunsets, and stars, and
vanishing dewdrops, now into a resolute and saner Lear bent
on knowing the cause of thunder; a pastime, finally, in
which even Jacob Grimm, for all his “combining” powers,
refused to join,—this mania for the direct interpreting of
myths has had its day and ceased to be. The end came with
the establishment of two facts, one negative and one positive.
Anthropology, ethnology, a close study of the history of culture,
of social institutions, of religion, led to the sound
conclusion that whatever else it might be, the mythology of
early man was not conterminous with the religion of early
man;<a id='r1099' /><a href='#f1099' class='c012'><sup>[1099]</sup></a> for religion in those stages is chiefly a matter of ceremony
and ritual forms. Suppose a person ignorant of the
rites of the Roman church undertaking to get a notion of its
ceremonies, and of the heart of its faith, by a study of the
<i>Legenda Aurea</i>, or any such body of tales! That was the
negative fact; the myth is not primitive religion, and is rarely
primitive creed. Again, anthropology, notably through its
great exponent Professor Tylor, established the positive fact
that myths are due to a kind of poetic faculty in primitive
man, the habit of animating, or, in modern phrase not quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>accurate for early stages of culture, of personifying what
went on about him.<a id='r1100' /><a href='#f1100' class='c012'><sup>[1100]</sup></a> Mr. Andrew Lang, while following
Professor Tylor in principle, has made room for the obscene,
the brutal, the silly, which can be found so plentifully in savage
myth and sporadically in the myths which we call classical.
To these ways of thinking came the sturdy Müllenhoff,
and after him, Mannhardt, an avowed student of customs and
popular thought; with Mannhardt’s later work, myth-guessing,
in which he had once been as wild as any,<a id='r1101' /><a href='#f1101' class='c012'><sup>[1101]</sup></a> came to an
end. It is now conceded that the source as well as the
meaning of most myths is veiled in the obscurity of early
animistic processes, while their later development belongs to
the poet altogether. “I have learned,” wrote Mannhardt<a id='r1102' /><a href='#f1102' class='c012'><sup>[1102]</sup></a>
to Müllenhoff, “to value poetical and literary production as an
essential factor in the formation of mythology.” Indeed, it
is not considering too curiously when Burckhardt<a id='r1103' /><a href='#f1103' class='c012'><sup>[1103]</sup></a> declares
that the renaissance in Italy so thoroughly revived the gods
of old pagan belief, that poets made new myths in the ancient
spirit.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a great mistake, however, to infer with certain bold
followers of Mr. Herbert Spencer—the German Lippert, for
example—that myths have nothing to do with primitive
religion and belong altogether to the poetic or fantastic instinct.
True, myths of the classic kind, barring the names
of god and goddess, were pretty well divorced from faith;
but Homer and Hesiod told tales unknown to the primitive
worshipper of Greece, and he had myths of his own.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>Schwartz, a valiant guesser, but rational on certain lines,
pointed out forty years ago<a id='r1104' /><a href='#f1104' class='c012'><sup>[1104]</sup></a> that perspective must be observed,
and that the origin of a myth must be held apart from
its development; often, indeed, by a hint here and a survival
there, one can feel one’s way back from the graceful, celestial
romance to a rude myth with all the awe of belief upon it.
It may be said with confidence that early myth excluded
mere tales of nature, drama of the shifting seasons, the flash
of sunlight on the waves, and all the romance of blushing
dawns and shepherded or wandering stars; these tales of
later origin belonged to the poet and his fantasy. Early
man did not go about commercing with the skies, nor did any
spur of occasion put him upon the telling of a natural process,
duly observed, in terms of a human history proportioned and
duly recorded. That is a definite poetical or allegorical
process, and means that the mind has a clear idea of two
separate systems, and can hold apart the world of fancy and
the world of fact, welding them together in conscious purpose.
It is poetry,<a id='r1105' /><a href='#f1105' class='c012'><sup>[1105]</sup></a> not primitive myth, which sees the
heavens as the psalmist saw them: <i>in them hath he set a tabernacle
for the sun, which is as a bridegroom coming out of his
chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race</i>. Myth,
indeed, may now and then lie at the heart of such poetical
achievement; but that elementary myth, the work of unconscious
animism, is rude and shapeless by comparison with
this finer stuff. Primitive myth is a block of marble with
more or less resemblance to some creature, a kind of fetish;
poets come and carve it into definite shape, individualize,
idealize, polish; next is formed the group, the celestial romance,
figures as on the frieze of a temple, with the loves
and the quarrels of the gods; and then, last stage of all, allegorical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>and satirical poets, a Lucian, a singer like him of the
Norse <i>Lokasenna</i>, make free with those fragments of myth
where no awe of belief can linger and hardly even the vital
grace of imagination. In all this coil but one stage has interest
for us; what can be said of the beginnings of poetry in
their relation to the beginnings of myth?</p>

<p class='c013'>A good test for the primitive stage of myth is first the
necessity, not the possibility of it, and secondly, the unconscious
character of the animating process. Dawn, starlight,
and laughing waters put no stress of questioning upon early
man; but the bolt from a stormcloud which laid low the
sheltering tree, or struck down members of the horde, a
nameless Terror bursting out of the unknown, came in more
questionable shape, and must have found expression in those
statements which a communal chorus, as was seen in the case
of the Botocudos, is fain to make about the fate and doings
of the horde itself. Mere ancestor-worship is not enough to
explain such a case;<a id='r1106' /><a href='#f1106' class='c012'><sup>[1106]</sup></a> every analogy of human action fails in
the presence of this flash and roar and destruction; the
unknown was there, as with modern phrase—“it” thunders<a id='r1107' /><a href='#f1107' class='c012'><sup>[1107]</sup></a>—and
the statement, repeated in indefinite chorus, had in it
the awe and fear and yearning about the unknown which still
go a long way to make up the idea of religion. But it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>unconscious, this process of animism; before one consciously
attributes personality to a force of nature, one must have the
two distinct ideas before the mind, and for early man such a
clear view was out of the question. Moreover, the idea of a
definite force, a definite personality, hardly belongs to the
primitive stage of myth; one must look at environment<a id='r1108' /><a href='#f1108' class='c012'><sup>[1108]</sup></a> and
the social organization. It is known that even the sacred
bull, and still more the “father” of the spirits, the chief god,
reflect nomadic life under a leader; while the leaderless horde
is girt about with a horde of spirits, the “they” of primitive
worship corresponding to the “we” of the social group.<a id='r1109' /><a href='#f1109' class='c012'><sup>[1109]</sup></a>
In this stage of culture only the horde itself, the social
group, can be in the case; poetic fancy on one side, ordered
bands of deities, high and low, with a supreme god over all, on
the other side, must be excluded. Earliest myth is simply
communal emotion, in choral statement, provoked by some
overwhelming act of vague and unseen powers. Early poetry
is always “occasional”; what strikes, like this thunderbolt,
into the life of the horde,<a id='r1110' /><a href='#f1110' class='c012'><sup>[1110]</sup></a> is a theme quite as solicitous as
good hunting, or the fight with rival clans, to fill a refrain
with repeated statement of fact, and, in time, to tempt the
improvising soloist into a phrase of wonder, awe, pity, propitiation.
Here, then, is a common ground for the beginnings
of poetry and the beginnings of myth,<a id='r1111' /><a href='#f1111' class='c012'><sup>[1111]</sup></a>—in communal, choral
statement. True, explanation of these doings of nature
may be a fertile source of myth in the later period when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>poetry and science are allied in a search after causes; but it
is clear that stating a fact is a process anterior to any explanation
of a fact. Is there not for modern man himself a comfort
in the lucid statement of things even before the things
are explained? The lawyer who states his case clearly has
half explained it and has prepared the jury to accept his explanation
of the facts. Scherer says that myth is due to some
primitive genius who listened to a thunderstorm, wished to
explain it, and conjectured that “the gods were fighting,”<a id='r1112' /><a href='#f1112' class='c012'><sup>[1112]</sup></a> a
theory adopted by the fellow-citizens of this genius, who thus
had “founded” a myth. But communal statement, with unconscious
animism in the terms of it,—communal, that is, in
its expression, and religious in its source,—is the only formula
for early myth which will agree with the conditions of
primitive life. To the cadence of the dance, in iterated
refrain, the horde as a social group took comfort in getting
the facts into a coherent statement; to repeat, in a rhythm
which made repetition easy and coherence possible, that the
“they” in question had done things which the “we” were
now recording, was a process not far removed from the iterated
statement that “we” had found a good hunt, made a
good catch, or what not. From the awful and inevitable, this
communal choral statement could pass to less destructive
doings; and from the pandemonium, the rout of spirits, step
by step with differentiation of the horde, with the rise of
tribal leaders, with the coming of an improvising singer, this
statement could pass to the pantheon<a id='r1113' /><a href='#f1113' class='c012'><sup>[1113]</sup></a> and hierarchy of gods.</p>

<p class='c013'>That myths of this sort, statements based on the feeling
for animated nature in its more obtrusive forms, were as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>early as the worship of ancestral spirits, is denied by Mr.
Herbert Spencer and his school, but without good cause.
It is illogical to affirm the beginnings of reason and in the
same breath to deny the beginnings of fancy. If ancestor-worship,
belief in “them,” was one of the earliest inferences
of the human mind, if one of the first conclusions which man
made outside the round of his daily struggle for food and
safety was to animate an unseen world, as early an act,
earlier indeed, was to animate the world he saw. Statements
about the doings of an animated nature, a horde of
echoes, movements, violent activities, girdling the horde of
men, were thus in all probability the earliest form of myth.
This statement, however, had less of that scientific leaning
than Scherer would make one believe; childish fear of harm
and childish hope of gain is a more likely attitude of mind
in primitive folk than childish curiosity about causes.
The choral statement, one may assume, took most easily a
reference to human needs and so became a hymn. The
hymn is essentially choral, and even under literary conditions
implies a congregation; the majesty and power of a
real hymn like Luther’s is out of all proportion to its merit
as a poem. It is the source of the hymn in a communal
emotion, and the direction of it to unseen forces, that give it
this majesty; and the poorest words gain might from these
conditions alone. A rude hymn of the horde to those spirits
unseen but felt, was therefore the probable beginning of
myth,—not a performance of the shaman before a passive
throng, and not a tale of celestial doings invented by some
early genius who took it upon him to pry into the mystery
of things. Of course there are fetish myths which have
come to be brutal and obscene, but were not brutal and
obscene when they were first formed;<a id='r1114' /><a href='#f1114' class='c012'><sup>[1114]</sup></a> there are also myths
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>invented in a later stage of culture to account for a ritual
or a belief<a id='r1115' /><a href='#f1115' class='c012'><sup>[1115]</sup></a> come down from early and obscure origins,
often with something of the fetish in them, as is probably
the case with the myth of Rome and the wolf; and there
are crude tales, due to as crude scientific instinct, to account
for physical phenomena, popular everywhere and in all times
down to the day of Uncle Remus. But all evidence of
ethnology, all the facts which have served to trace the line
of poetical evolution, go to make probable the social and
communal and choral beginnings of the myth which has
the awe of belief upon it. As might be expected, fragments
of this old choral refrain which bound the myth to the community
and to its religious emotion, have come down to us
embedded in later and poetical myth; and it has been shown
that a refrain of grief<a id='r1116' /><a href='#f1116' class='c012'><sup>[1116]</sup></a> for the loss or departure of a god,
demigod, hero, has often been made a proper name and the
nucleus for a new myth. This choral cry of the horde has
great interest for the student of myths; and if the etymology
be probable which makes the word “god” mean “one
that is called upon,” here is more beckoning that way.
Heavier stress should be laid upon the choral hymn as
expression of emotion from a homogeneous horde of men
toward a homogeneous horde of spirits, and upon the dance
and symbolic action which went with the song, taking in
time now a ritual and now a dramatic guise.<a id='r1117' /><a href='#f1117' class='c012'><sup>[1117]</sup></a> In other
words, this choral hymn, danced and sung,—if one will,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>danced and sung about some symbol of animated and superhuman
but by no means individualized or “personified”
powers, and with accompaniment of sacrifice, with festal
recapitulation, even, of action inspired by the help of these
powers,—was on one hand the source of religious ceremony,
which later, in its mutilated and incomprehensible refrains
held so stubbornly in festal worship, with the worshipped
powers hovering about unseen, and, on the other hand, source
of a secular drama, where, as in Greece, only an altar remained
as visible hint of sacred origins, and only the intervention
of gods and the abiding sense of fate kept alive the old
purpose of the hymn. This chorus, dealing with the doings
of spirits, like the chorus that dealt with labour and hunt and
communal experience at large, was also the beginning of myths
which, like the older refrain, fell under the power of improvisation
and so passed into poetic control, keeping pace with
the tribal development of hero, chieftain, conqueror, king,
blending with legend, and at last finding record in the epos.</p>

<p class='c013'>The impression of natural forces upon man, and the reactionary
process which imposes man’s imagination upon
natural forces, have another side; they make up not only the
material of poetry, but also its manner, its style. The second
process, when it animated nature with something like
human will, human passion, human fate, and while it did this
with the awe of belief upon it, has been seen to pass into
myth. Roughly speaking, one may say that the early and
unconscious process is myth, and the later, conscious process,
when directed not to a statement or story but only to
a word or phrase, is the figure or trope of personification.
The first process, however, where human life is treated in
terms of nature, is conveniently known as metaphor, although
precision in the use of these terms is not so much observed
as desired; and metaphor, too, must be regarded as first an
unconscious and then a conscious process.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>Myth and personification need no further comment, and
we shall now consider the metaphor as mainstay of poetical
style; one word, however, may be in place for an early and
unconscious form of personification, which deals with language
rather than with fact, and so must be sundered from
myth—the grammatical gender of words.<a id='r1118' /><a href='#f1118' class='c012'><sup>[1118]</sup></a> A bit of myth may
lie, of course, in those expressions which hover between the
natural and the grammatical gender, and is not always easy
to explain from the primitive point of view, however appropriate
the choice may seem to a modern mind; why is the
sun feminine in all Germanic languages, and the moon masculine?
Day is masculine, night is feminine; earth seems
always feminine, and “mother” is no new epithet for her.
Death, pestilence, sickness, have personifications that are
more than gender; Servians think of the plague as a woman
in white who steals upon her victims, and to modern Greeks
sickness is also a woman, blind and old, who feels her way
from house to house.<a id='r1119' /><a href='#f1119' class='c012'><sup>[1119]</sup></a> But even now the process may be
unconscious, as one observes in languages like English,
which have lost their inflections and can give gender only
by pronouns; Grimm’s elaborate categories for the three
genders are sadly baffled by the habit which calls a ship a
“man-of-war” and bids the bystander watch “her” sail by.<a id='r1120' /><a href='#f1120' class='c012'><sup>[1120]</sup></a>
Again, there is transfer to reckon with; the first name for
an object, as will be shown presently to be the case with
metaphors, yields later to a name more precise; and when
a ship, or the like, is in question, motion and seeming life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>could give one vague name, while later and nearer acquaintance
found an appellation in technical qualities. On the
whole, it will be best if we leave gender to animism, to incipient
myth, unconscious metaphor, and whatever other forces
went to the making of words, and turn to metaphor itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>To those who hold with the Abbé Dubos<a id='r1121' /><a href='#f1121' class='c012'><sup>[1121]</sup></a> that poetic
style is the most important factor in differencing poetry
from prose, and demands the greatest genius in the poet,
it may seem a hard saying to call the early stage of figurative
language unconscious metaphor. The habit of describing
primitive poetry in terms of modern verse imposes on
these early stages a teleological element quite foreign to
the conditions which ethnology and the sense of evolution
compel one to assume for the beginnings of such an art.
Poetry, says Cardinal Newman, in his little essay,<a id='r1122' /><a href='#f1122' class='c012'><sup>[1122]</sup></a> has to
adopt metaphorical language as “the only poor means allowed
for imparting to others its intense feelings,” which refuse
“the feebleness of ordinary words”; and with this <i>raison
d’être</i> for the metaphor, one goes on to inquire how it is made.
The transfer from a literal to a figurative or metaphorical
expression, one finds, is made on the basis of a comparison
and an observed resemblance, so that a metaphor is compressed
or abridged simile, and the simile must be the fundamental
figure in poetry. So the schools have taught time
out of mind.<a id='r1123' /><a href='#f1123' class='c012'><sup>[1123]</sup></a> Even Scherer,<a id='r1124' /><a href='#f1124' class='c012'><sup>[1124]</sup></a> eager to hit the new note,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>and fixing his gaze on primitive conditions, is sure that
poetical figures spring from the innate love of comparison;
even Dr. R. M. Meyer,<a id='r1125' /><a href='#f1125' class='c012'><sup>[1125]</sup></a> studying old Germanic poetry, finds
that its metaphors prove the fundamental character of the
simile from which they spring.<a id='r1126' /><a href='#f1126' class='c012'><sup>[1126]</sup></a> A little reflection, however,
ought to convince candid minds that in the chronological,
if not in the logical, order of development, the metaphor
comes first and the simile is an expanded metaphor; this
is proved not only by the psychological argument, but by
the facts in the case. Those similes from Polynesian poetry
given by Letourneau<a id='r1127' /><a href='#f1127' class='c012'><sup>[1127]</sup></a> represent no primitive stage, and to
the long comparisons of Homer<a id='r1128' /><a href='#f1128' class='c012'><sup>[1128]</sup></a> no wise man will now
appeal as examples of the artless and natural in poetic
style. Savages, like Mr. Shandy, may dearly love a comparison;
but it is a logical process, a kind of incipient
science, in any case subsequent to the unconscious stage of
metaphors. For, as a matter of fact, wherever one finds
verse which all tests of value show to have the primitive
quality, similes and the comparative impulse in general conspicuously
fail; this is the case with ballads,<a id='r1129' /><a href='#f1129' class='c012'><sup>[1129]</sup></a> with choral and
refrain of communal origins everywhere, and with the ruder
stages of our old Germanic poetry.<a id='r1130' /><a href='#f1130' class='c012'><sup>[1130]</sup></a> Anglo-Saxon poetry,
though all its artistic and literary influences urged it to
comparison, simile, allegory,—the latter a peculiarly Christian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>invention,—is absolutely hostile to the simile except
in passages copied almost slavishly from a literary source;
and this consideration led the present writer<a id='r1131' /><a href='#f1131' class='c012'><sup>[1131]</sup></a> twenty years
ago to find ground for opposing the traditional doctrine of
metaphors as founded in the first instance upon an observed
likeness. Everybody grants that early metaphor
differs from late; a child calls the bird’s nest a house, not
because it compares the nest with a house, but because it has
the idea of house and has not the specific idea of nest; and so
it would and does call the horse’s stable, the rabbit’s burrow,
what not, a house, until wider knowledge and specific information
give a distinct name for each. Then, and not until
then, with two separate ideas before the mind, is the metaphor
based upon a definite comparison, and the transfer a
conscious process. In other words, the metaphor was not
a metaphor at the start, save in the unconscious force of it;
so with the early myth, where there was no thought of comparing
a force of nature and a human act, but simply an
effort to express the force along the only possible path, the
path of animism. This, moreover, is at first nothing but
direct statement. In all primitive verse, including its survival,
the ballad, it is simple statement, and not metaphor in
any modern shape, that constitutes the style. One cannot
express the literal by the figurative until one has got a conception
of literal and figurative as discrete things; the first
stage of metaphor, then, is unconscious, a confusion, if one
will, or, better, a flexibility in application of the small stock
of words. In a little article<a id='r1132' /><a href='#f1132' class='c012'><sup>[1132]</sup></a> on metaphor and poetry, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>writer proposed this sequence of development in poetical
figures: metaphor pure and simple, what has just been called
the unconscious metaphor, stands first;<a id='r1133' /><a href='#f1133' class='c012'><sup>[1133]</sup></a> then comes metaphor
with the literal peeping through, that is, where literal
and figurative are joined, but in a separable fashion, the
literal statement involving but not expressing contradiction
in its terms; lastly the quite conscious metaphor, where
both terms are expressed, and where the mind is fully alive
to the gap between reality and trope, a metaphor which may
be either the implied simile (“he is a lion”) or the stated
simile (“he is <i>like</i> a lion”). Evidently now, there comes a stage
in poetic expression where that need for freshness and force
sends the poet back over this path; the logical expression
of resemblance is too literal, and he turns to the metaphor
again, and so justifies the standing definition of it as a compressed
or abridged simile. That, however, is not the history
of its evolutionary growth.<a id='r1134' /><a href='#f1134' class='c012'><sup>[1134]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Turning to the nearer subject, we may now ask how the
differentiation came about in poetic speech, and where it
belongs in the beginnings of poetry. It is more than probable
that earliest language was social in a sense now hard
to understand; so tremendous was this step from brute
forms of intercourse to human speech that it must have
taken place under a social pressure infinitely removed from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>conditions of what now passes for “conversation.” As with
the earth itself, these psychical changes were volcanic.
The refrain of concerted labour, upon which Bücher has
wisely laid such stress, the refrain of festal emotion over a
victorious fight, the cadenced sounds in concert with consent
of individual energies alert for a common cause,—it was
under such vast and unusual social pressure that the greatest
of social triumphs came about. Hence it may well seem
absurd to talk of earliest song in words as a “heightened”
or emotional speech, speech raised above the level of ordinary
conversation; for what needs could have produced
ordinary conversation before the wholly imperative and
extraordinary occasions which called out the greatest resources
of social effort? It is to be denied, therefore, that
“poetic” expression was lifted out of ordinary and conversational
expression; and it may well have been that choral
hymns with earliest statement of myth,<a id='r1135' /><a href='#f1135' class='c012'><sup>[1135]</sup></a> choral song with
earliest statement and gestured imitation of communal achievement,
and choral refrains of labour, formed the beginnings
of speech, which was mainly a recapitulation of action, and
therefore mainly a matter of verbs. It is conceded that
verbs came before substantives, for action, as in labour, is
easily paired with gesture and sound; names for things, the
substantives, the singular forms of the pronoun, are a different
affair, and lend themselves more readily to the
individual and to improvisation. A statement of action,
subjective or objective, contemporary or reminiscent, is easily
made by a chorus, whether of primitive men, or of modern
children with their “Now we go round the mulberry-bush”;
and the statement as naturally repeats itself as refrain to the
dancing or whatever cadenced motion is in the case. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>is the communal or centripetal impulse. The centrifugal,
individual impulse lays hold of an unvaried repetition of
rhythm,<a id='r1136' /><a href='#f1136' class='c012'><sup>[1136]</sup></a> and evolves couplet and stanza, with variations of
rime, assonance, and the like; laying hold of the expression
itself, and by a parallel process applied to style instead of
to form, this impulse leads to variation in expression,<a id='r1137' /><a href='#f1137' class='c012'><sup>[1137]</sup></a> to
something in one verse very like the corresponding part of
the preceding verse, yet different. Step by step, with the
aid of the “Apollinian” instinct, metaphor becomes conscious
of itself and of its own effort; it works out a poetic
dialect, which, contrary to the common notion, is an increasing
and not a decreasing factor in poetry. It begins with
flexibility of application, unconscious of a difference, for there
is no difference; sees at last a gap between itself and the
literal, which has been formed by the rise of a conversational
and “ordinary” language; avoids this literal, and shuns this
ordinary, until in absurd excess it reaches the scaldic kenning,
or finds a pedant<a id='r1138' /><a href='#f1138' class='c012'><sup>[1138]</sup></a> making dictionaries of metaphors proper
for the poet to use in this or that case. Finally, it returns
upon itself, seeking simplicity, if it can find it, with a Wordsworth,
but still refusing to join hands with the talk of everyday
life.<a id='r1139' /><a href='#f1139' class='c012'><sup>[1139]</sup></a> Be all this as it may be, the metaphor of the verb
is both older and more communal than the metaphor of the
substantive, which better fits the inventor’s case and may well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>have been the origin of the riddle,<a id='r1140' /><a href='#f1140' class='c012'><sup>[1140]</sup></a> conceded to be a very
ancient form of literature. As in the beginning, so even
now. The more individual, artistic, and subjective poetry becomes,
the more it tends to deal in intricate metaphor, the
less it has of the simplicity due to statement of action in
simple because communal phrase; and whenever reactions
set in toward that communal state of things, action comes
to the front, intricate figure vanishes, verbs have more to do,
substantives less, and adjectives almost nothing.<a id='r1141' /><a href='#f1141' class='c012'><sup>[1141]</sup></a> A reactionary
movement of this sort lies before us in the verse of
Mr. Kipling.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />THE TRIUMPH OF THE ARTIST</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>From this brief raid upon the territory of poetic style, we
return to the fortunes of improvisation and its defeat at the
hands of a more deliberate art.<a id='r1142' /><a href='#f1142' class='c012'><sup>[1142]</sup></a> Among the countless passages
in which the poet has talked of his profession, not the
least notable is that <i>impromptu</i> of De Musset in which he
says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Faire un travail exquis, plein de crainte et de charme,</div>
      <div class='line'>Faire une perle d’une larme,</div>
      <div class='line'>Du poëte ici-bas voila la passion,—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>that is, of the poet whom one takes seriously, the artist, the solitary
maker of things beautiful. Quite different is the idea of
the poet implied in a pleasant little jest that passed between
De Musset and Sainte-Beuve. The critic had declared that in
the majority of men there is a poet who dies young while the
man himself survives; whereupon De Musset pointed out
that Sainte-Beuve had unwittingly put his thought into a
good Alexandrine, and thus had helped to prove that the
poet in the case was not dead but asleep. Between this poet
who dies young or slumbers in each of us, and the artist in
verse who makes pearls out of tears, there is now only a fantastic
and fugitive connection; in mediæval times, in rude
agricultural communities, and under primitive conditions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>this slumbering poet was awake and active, and the step
from his ranks to that of artistry was of the easiest and
shortest kind. The story of the poet is simple. Detaching
himself from the throng in short improvisations, he
comes at last to independence, and turns his active fellows
into a mute audience; dignity and mystery hedge him about,
his art is touched with the divine, and like his brother, the
priest, he mediates between men and an imaginative, spiritual
world, living, too, like the priest, at the charges of the
community. This was the upward path; another path led the
minstrel into ways of disrepute, where dignity and mystery
were unknown, where the songsmith was made a sturdy beggar
and an outlaw by act of parliament, and where there was
little comfort even in being the singing-man at Windsor.
With the upward path there is no space here to deal; the
poet by divine right, moreover, has had chroniclers enough
and to spare, and it only remains to note the later stages
through which his communal brother passed on the way to
what seems an everlasting silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the chosen singer stands out single from the throng
and the throng lapses passive into the background, so the
poem which this singer makes becomes a traditional and
remembered affair, with epic movement and an interest
which causes art and substance of the song to outweigh any
mere expression of contemporary emotion. This, indeed,
lingers in the chorus or refrain of a ballad; but even the
choral impulse passes away as the story and the style of
the poem increase in importance, and it disappears behind the
rhapsode,<a id='r1143' /><a href='#f1143' class='c012'><sup>[1143]</sup></a> who chants or recites his verses to a listening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>crowd. With permanent record, with the making of manuscript,<a id='r1144' /><a href='#f1144' class='c012'><sup>[1144]</sup></a>
poetic art at its best ceases to be a matter of voice
and ear; two silent men, the poet and his reader, communicate
by means of the written or the printed page, itself the
result of solitary thought, and subject, at the other end of
the process, to the same deliberation and inference in the
appreciation of it as the poet employed in the making.<a id='r1145' /><a href='#f1145' class='c012'><sup>[1145]</sup></a> But
the obvious advantages of immediate contact, of living voice,
gesture, personal emotion, in the poet, and palpable interest,
whether active or passive, on the part of the audience, made
the disintegration and decay of this primitive group a very
slow affair. It survives even yet in the popular “reading,”
and, with higher pretensions, on the stage; but a far more
interesting survival, and more complete, is found among that
people of strong poetic impulses who gave the <i>improvvisatore</i>
his place of honour down to quite recent times. The art was
so common that it got the compliment of parody; Pulci imitates
the <i>improvvisatori</i> in his <i>Morgante</i>,<a id='r1146' /><a href='#f1146' class='c012'><sup>[1146]</sup></a> and worse yet, the
luckless bards who made extemporaneous verses at the table
of Leo X were whipped if these verses were not of the
smoothest. But this is only the shady side of the art.
Quadrio<a id='r1147' /><a href='#f1147' class='c012'><sup>[1147]</sup></a> thinks that if the human mind anywhere puts forth
its noblest powers, it is in that craft called <i>canto all’ improvviso</i>;<a id='r1148' /><a href='#f1148' class='c012'><sup>[1148]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>this, he says, was the beginning of poetry, and is still one
of its best achievements; and he goes on to give some hints for
the ambitious. Every one knows the romantic figure of Corinne;
but a better example for the present purpose is Perfetti,
an actual <i>improvvisatore</i> whose feats drew attention abroad as
well as at home. He is mentioned in Spence’s <i>Anecdotes</i>;
and a few facts about him<a id='r1149' /><a href='#f1149' class='c012'><sup>[1149]</sup></a> may be given here in order to
show how the fatal breach between poetry of mere entertainment,
now in full process of degeneration at the hands of the
minstrel and balladmonger, and poetry of creative and imaginative
art, now veiled in mystery and seen of none but consecrated
eyes, was thought to be healed by the rapt strains
of these improvising poets of Italy. What grace, they argued,
could be lacking to one that was crowned at the Capitol,
and stood in the stead of Petrarch? Son of a cavalier
and a noble lady, Perfetti began very early his office as a
bard; his Latin biographer, with vast gravity, says the child
made “what in our tongue is called rime” at eleven months;
small wonder that he became famous when still a youth, and
was welcomed at parties of every sort, weddings, social discussions,
what not, where he exercised his gift of extemporaneous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>song. Of a summer night<a id='r1150' /><a href='#f1150' class='c012'><sup>[1150]</sup></a> he would improvise
songs in praise of some family, singing under their windows,
an amiable fancy. Cianfogni heard him on these occasions,
and says that the poems were often taken down in writing by
persons concealed from the poet’s view; but he rarely wrote
verses of his own, finding that sort of composition by no means
to his taste. He refused to undertake an epic, though the
pope urged him thus to rival Tasso and Ariosto. <i>Ottava rima</i>
was his favourite verse, and he was fond of a musical accompaniment.
His memory, too, was prodigious; in brief, Cianfogni
hopes that this Moses will lead poetry back from its exile
in a land of paper and print to its old glories of the living voice
and the hearing of the ear. The Latin pamphlet, which has
some interesting remarks on related matters in poetry, says
that Perfetti learned his art at Sienna from one Bindius
“poeta extemporalis,” who excelled in that sort of verse
which Berni composed, and which was called from its
founder Bernesque. Come to his full powers, Perfetti shunned
no kind of poem, and excelled in every branch of the art.
His songs were repeated on all sides and passed current
among the people; while, for the rest, he could sing
<i>majora</i> too, winning applause from the pope himself, and
getting crowned at the Capitol in a function of unusual
splendour. Physically, his poetic ardour was formidable and
“almost passed belief,” eyes aflame, brow contracted, panting
bosom, and a flow of words so vehement and swift that
his harp-player was often left far in the rear; the song done,
Perfetti could hardly stand for exhaustion, and slept but
little on the ensuing night.<a id='r1151' /><a href='#f1151' class='c012'><sup>[1151]</sup></a> So strenuous a life told on his
health, one must think; at any rate, he died of paralysis in
July, 1747.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>This account of Perfetti is amusing, but much may be
learned from it. Significant is the fact that he always sang
his verses as he composed them, kept to one fixed rhythm,
and had a harp to accompany him,—music once more in her
original function as muse. Significant, too, is his aversion
from pen and paper, his sensible refusal to try epic and
poems of great length. That physical excitement and that
reaction, too, are in line with the old communal elation, and
are at no great remove from similar states of the body in
medicine men, magicians, priests of the oracle, and even the
rapt poet of a traditional prime. Significant, finally, is the
feeling on the part of his friends that with him poetry was
going back to first principles, and could thus bathe in the
fountain of youth. But it was not to be. The communal
fashion of poetry was already a lost cause. <i>Soli cantare
periti Arcades</i>; the “poet in every man” is passive and not
active; and the gift of improvisation comes now in vain, for
the conditions which once gave it sole validity are vanished
beyond recall. Shakspere’s kindred three, the lunatic, the
lover, and the poet, once frankly accepted as public and privileged
characters, sacred even, must now play the fool nowhere
but in their own houses.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c013'>Whatever it gained by the process, poetry has been forced
to give up its immediate power over men, and to console itself
with what Herder called a “paper eternity.” This triumphant
artist, who now holds its destinies in trust, stands at such a
remove from its beginnings, his very art seems so opposed to
rude songs of the prime, and the public making of verse<a id='r1152' /><a href='#f1152' class='c012'><sup>[1152]</sup></a> has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>become so deject and wretched, that one must face again,
and this time in conclusion of the whole matter, a question
of identity. Is it all one and the same art? Has all this
pother about refrain and rhythm concerned the beginnings
of actual poetry, or only hints and forewarnings as alien to
poetry itself as the brute beast is alien to civilized man?
Three answers may be made to this question. With Aristotle,
or rather with what one takes to be the meaning of
Aristotle, one may sunder as into two distinct arts the improvisation
of primitive throngs and the deliberate poetry
of maker and seer. Here, of course, is a denial of identity.
Again, with Scherer,<a id='r1153' /><a href='#f1153' class='c012'><sup>[1153]</sup></a> one may ignore improvisation by
throngs, recognize only the difference between oral and written
record, and assume for earliest poetry conditions analogous
to those of modern times,—the need for entertainment
on the part of a “public,” and the answering performance
of an “entertainer” who languishes or thrives according
to the state of the literary market. Here is identity
outright, but far too much of it. Whatever the merits of his
<i>Poetik</i>, and it has great merits, Scherer was doomed to failure
from the first, because, as Bücher<a id='r1154' /><a href='#f1154' class='c012'><sup>[1154]</sup></a> rightly objected, no one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>can arrive at the spirit of primitive art by setting out from
the categories of modern art. Moreover, Scherer flies in the
face of facts, while the facts which go with that Aristotelian
theory are surprisingly accurate. Not a syllable in Aristotle’s
brief account of poetic origins has been assailed by all the
evidence gathered for modern ethnology, and by all the historical
and comparative work undertaken on the basis of this
new material. Nevertheless, one hesitates before the Aristotelian
theory of absolute difference, just as one hesitates
before the notion of absolute identity. True, one must
sunder the epoch of instinct, of throngs, and of improvisation,
from the epoch of deliberate and solitary art; but this
does not warrant one in granting to the second epoch alone
the name and fact of poetry. There is a third answer to
the question, reasonable in every way, which would neither
transfer modern conditions to the remote past, nor yet blot
out one of the two periods of poetry, but would see in all
manifestations of the art, early and late, the presence and
play of two forces, one overwhelmingly conspicuous at the
beginning, the other overwhelmingly conspicuous now; forces
which, in their different adjustments, have conditioned the
progress of song and verse at every stage.</p>

<p class='c013'>For it is clear that two forces<a id='r1155' /><a href='#f1155' class='c012'><sup>[1155]</sup></a> have been always active
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>not only in letters but in human life, and that these forces
answer to the communal influence dominant in early poetry
and the centrifugal, individual tendency in modern verse.
One phase of this dualism in poetry has been discussed
above;<a id='r1156' /><a href='#f1156' class='c012'><sup>[1156]</sup></a> it is now in order to look at it not with separation
and analysis in view, but rather with an eye to the higher
synthesis. No one questions the antithesis between man
solitary and man social; and few will question the relative
dominance of this or that type for any given age of the
world. There are times so stamped by the individual impulse
that all kinds of covenant, system, institution, are
attacked, and nowhere more fiercely than in affairs of religion
and of state. Seventeenth-century England is a case of
this kind; individuals rush off to the wilderness to think and
dream, and then rush back again to found a new sect. On
the large stage the state is Cromwell, and on the small stage
Quakerism is George Fox. Again, and for the other view,
seventeenth-century France<a id='r1157' /><a href='#f1157' class='c012'><sup>[1157]</sup></a> is a place of order, tradition,
and collective peace. True, names are also current along
with creed and rule, Bossuet, Boileau, and the great Louis
himself; but it is dogma and order, not disintegration, that
they proclaim. Consent is supreme here, as dissent is supreme
across the Channel. In any line of human effort, and
at any given time, one of these forces is dominant. But
after all, it is only of a relative dominance that one can
speak, and these labels that the historian puts upon his
entire epoch are good until another historian, with another
phase of it in mind, takes up the brush. There is constant
play of those opposing forces, and if the collective spirit
brought order, tradition, cohesion, to the late seventeenth
and the early eighteenth century, the individual spirit even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>then fostered, as never before, the idea of a great man as
mainspring in social progress. So, too, if disintegration ruled
in seventeenth-century England, there was no lack of the
collective and communal force; witness the social organization
and religious democracy of the Quakers themselves. It
was a time of sects and schisms; it was also a time of commonwealths
spiritual, political, and social.</p>

<p class='c013'>With this constant play and change of the two forces in
mind, one may return to poetry itself and attempt a summary
of the whole case, noting the alternation of communal
and individual impulses, and seeking, by a study of their
manifestations, to bring the beginning of the art into line
with its present condition. It has been shown how easily
confusion besets a discussion of that savage culture which is
now declared communal in every way, and now painted as
individual to the extreme of brute selfishness. So, too, when
one says that early poetry was overwhelmingly choral and
communal, that modern poetry is overwhelmingly individual,
one has full warrant of facts; but it is well to remember just
what these facts are, and so avoid ill-considered criticism.
Poetry was a social creation and essentially communal at the
start; although some of the most careful investigations in the
early history of man<a id='r1158' /><a href='#f1158' class='c012'><sup>[1158]</sup></a> are now putting stress upon the fact
that for perhaps thousands of years humanity was hovering
on the far border of communal organization, and led a mainly
selfish and unsocial life. Man of this period did not have to
unite with his fellows for purposes of mutual help and for
defence against a common foe; like many wild animals, he
could have roved about in smallest groups, each member of
which got its own food for itself, often, as in favoured climates,
with a minimum of exertion. Hence, too, for long
stretches of time, no need of organized labour, of any economic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>system. But these needs all came at last;<a id='r1159' /><a href='#f1159' class='c012'><sup>[1159]</sup></a> and when
primitive man confronted them, he began his social history,
and communal life was a fact. Here, too, in these rude
communal beginnings, consent and rhythm played their
parts. Now it is no argument whatever against the assumption
that earliest poetry was strongly communal to say that
earliest social man himself was only feebly and tentatively
communal; the point is that where he was communal it was
to a degree rendered utterly impossible for the present, and
almost incredible for the past, by reason of the very social
progress in which that communism, that consent, formed the
first step. So, too, when it is said that the individual element
in primitive poetic art was at a minimum, there is nothing
counter to this assertion in the fact that early man was
close to the absolutely individual and centrifugal state;
whenever the individual made himself felt in poetry, it was
as an individual bound by the new social tie, and his individual
expression was a part of the communal expression. But,
as was just said, the new communal element, so far as it
went, was communal to an almost exclusive degree; not until
after long ages of alternating collective and individual forces,
working within the social union, was the individual socially
free to make himself master in a wholly social art. It is a
fact full of significance that the nearer social groups, like the
Veddahs and the Botocudos, stand to the brutish, unstable,
isolated, and wandering life of earliest man, so much the
closer and more emphatic is their tentative expression of
social consent in the dance, which is almost a continuous
ring of humanity, with just two prominent characteristics:
the tightest possible clasp of individual to individual, and the
most exact consent of rhythm in the limbs that are free to
move. Yet when the dance is past, and the ring is broken,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>its individual members go back to a life marked by hardly
any social traits. As to labour, Bücher<a id='r1160' /><a href='#f1160' class='c012'><sup>[1160]</sup></a> puts stress on the
priority of women in gregarious songs of toil; while men
were stalking game, the women combined in movements and
chorals of work,<a id='r1161' /><a href='#f1161' class='c012'><sup>[1161]</sup></a> and a certain antithesis is not far to seek
which would give women the primacy in early stages of
poetry, while men lord it almost exclusively in these latter
days. No woman, with the doubtful exception of Sappho,
has crossed the bounds of what is known as minor poetry;
no woman, though women sing and have most need of song
from the cradle to the death-bed, has been a great composer;
no woman, not even George Eliot or any of her clever
cousins in New England, has yet laid hold of that quality
which goes with triumphs of the individual poet, the quality
of humour. Why women were so prominent in the communal
poetry of the beginnings, is easily answered and is a
question to be asked; why women fail as individuals to reach
the higher peaks of Parnassus, is a question perhaps not to
be asked, although the answer might well seem a distinct
recognition of woman’s great services to the art. At certain
stages of poetry women have been nursing mothers without
whose love and zeal for song poetry would have fallen into
evil ways indeed. In any case, woman looms larger than
man in that shadowy world of beginnings; her life was
more consistently social, and her quicker emotional nature,
whatever it may seem to modern eyes, gave her an advantage
over the more stolid and more solitary male.</p>

<p class='c013'>How is one to bind these beginnings to the present condition
of poetry? With that alternation of social, choral
impulses and impulses of the individual, poetry is not simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>swinging back and forth between two positions, but makes
a steady advance. As in social progress, at each fresh occasion
on which the individual isolates himself from society,
he takes with him the accumulated force that society, by
its main function, has stored up from traditions of the past,
and as whenever he returns to society, he brings back as
his own contribution a fresh strength derived from more or
less unfettered thinking over vital problems, so it is with
communal and artistic forces in poetry. For the mere case
of poetry as a body of literature, on one hand, and the poet
as an individual on the other hand, this relation is plain
enough, and speaks for itself. Poetry does even more for
the poet than the poet does for poetry. But when one
passes from materials to conditions and elements, asking
for what is social or communal in the modern poetry of art
at its best, few answers, if any, are to be heard. Some
answer, however, is demanded, and it must try to rise to
the height of so great an argument. Where, then, is the
trace of direct communal elements in great poetry?</p>

<p class='c013'>The modern artist in poetry triumphs mainly by the music
of his verse and by the imaginative power which is realized
in his language, often merely by the suggestion in his language;
for poetry, as Sainte-Beuve prettily remarked, lies
not in telling the story but in making one dream it. For
present purposes, then, it will be enough to look at the
formal quality of rhythm and the more creative quality of
imagination. Assuming that the second chapter of this
book proved what it set out to prove, one must see in
rhythm, or regularity of recurrence due to the consenting
cadence of a throng, the main representative of communal
forces; although repetition in its other forms goes back to
the very condition of choral poetry itself. Because the critics
take rhythm and verbal repetition largely for granted in the
work of any great poet, and look rather to his excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>differences in thought and in variation of style, one must
not ignore the immense significance of those communal
forces in the poetry of art. It is not the mere rhythm,
grateful, exquisite, and powerful as that may be, but it is
what lies behind the rhythm, that gives it such a place in
poetry; it appeals through the measures to the cadent feet,
and so through the cadent feet to that consent of sympathy
which is perhaps the noblest thing in all human life. The
triumphs of modern prose are great, but they fail one and
all to take the place of rhythmic utterance; they fail even
to do at their best what poetry often does in its mediocrity.
The short story commands pathos to an almost intolerable
degree; Balzac’s heartless daughters bring old Père Goriot
close to the plight of Lear, so far as this pathos is concerned;
and when Ibsen wishes to touch the quick of things
in a play, he does well, from his point of view, to discard
jingling verses and to use the prose of common conversation,
thus bringing one face to face with the pathos of bare
and actual life,—very actual and very bare. Pathos, indeed,
all these prose triumphs show, and pathological is the word
for them. They belong to surgery. Poetry, recoiling from
bare and actual life, has a very different function. Significant
is the popular use of this word, poetry; when one says
that the poetry has gone out of one’s life, one means that
something very like Ibsen has come in, that one can no
longer idealize life and can see in it only its flatness and
bareness. The cadence of those feet has ceased, and with
it the hint of consent and sympathy. For when the Veddahs
leave their solitary and often desperate search for food,
come together, cling each to each as close as may be in that
arrow-dance of theirs, and sing for hours their monotonous
chorus, it is certainly not done in order that they may see
bare and actual life, but rather that they may escape it and
forget it. It is not surgery they seek, but medicine, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>this either tonic or opiate; indeed, the twofold function of
poetry could be ranged under such a head. Tonic were
the cheery chorals of actual labour, old as social man, songs
of battle and the march, festal recapitulation of hunt and
work and fight. They idealized life; they appealed to sympathy,
and heartened the solitary by a sense of brotherhood.
So, in these latter days, tonic are the passages which stir the
heart of a young man who reads wisely his Goethe, and
tonic too—why not?—all those jingling platitudes beloved
and quoted of the youth who make valedictory speeches in
the village school; tonic, in fine, whatever <i>gedenke zu leben</i>
rings out from poets of the virile and the sane. And from
the beginning to the end, this tonic poetry falls naturally
into the rhythm of a march. On the other hand, poetry is
an opiate; the solitary man ran to a choral throng not only
that he might find brotherhood and sympathy, but also that
he might forget himself,—a task which the wild chorus of
Dionysos could accomplish no less surely and thoroughly
than the very grapes and vintage of the god. Like these,
poetry helped man to forget his troubles; like these, the
whirl and motion of cadenced dancing brought about a kind
of intoxication; and the graceful words with which Sir
William Temple concludes his essay on poetry have gained
a deeper and yet a more literal meaning through the researches
of ethnology and the proof which now lies before
us of the extent to which primitive man has found in dance
and song a refuge from the bare hideousness of life. For
this early art, for this soothing and flattering function of it,
the main force lay in rhythm; and if one wishes to call
rhythm the conventional part of poetry, one degrades it not
a whit by the name. Early poetry was exactly that,—a
conventional affair, an idealized view of life, now tonic and
now opiate in its aim. But whether to hearten or to soothe,
stimulant or sedative, poetry found its initial source of energy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>in rhythm; most intimate of all the arts, and nearest to the
heart of man, poetry will part with this pulse of rhythm only
when the sea shall part with its tides.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rhythm, then, binds in a single bond both the beginning
and the end. But its formula is one which any rimer can
use with more or less skill, and modern verse makes far
wider and deeper claims, claims which no one has thought to
carry back to the beginnings of poetry. Where, in those
early days, was that rare quality of imagination to which the
critic now appeals when he sets off a masterpiece of poetry
from its rivals? To answer this question, one cannot cite
mere history; chorus and refrain and shards of rustic rime
must be left aside; and one must even beg a little help from
æsthetics itself: <i>so muss denn doch die Hexe dran</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Described in its simplest form, the quality of modern poetic
imagination seems to be a power, by suggestive use of musical
and figurative human speech, to put the solitary reader
into the mood which would arise naturally in him under the
pressure of certain actual events or of a certain actual scene.
To repeat the phrase of Sainte-Beuve, “la poésie ne consiste
pas à tout dire, mais à tout faire rêver.” Even primitive
poetry was an idealization, an abstraction, a narcotic, a kind
of waking dream; modern poetry is also a dream, but with
deeper and wider issues, and with a purpose far more clearly
defined. Now the great passages of poetry, such as those
which Matthew Arnold used as tests for excellence, easily
fall into one of the two categories; they revive, even create,
the mood felt either in the pressure of actual events or in the
presence of an actual scene. That beautiful line which
Arnold quotes from Dante is simply the imaginative and
conventionalized sense of beatific worship such as all men
have felt in varying degree; while for the thousand cases
where nature is treated, there can be no doubt whatever of
the tie which binds even the most imaginative and solitary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>poet to the old singing throng. Nature is nothing without
man to interpret it; and neither man nor nature could stand
in this mutual relation had not social consent and social processes
created these abstract ideas, this very “man,” this very
“nature,” by the reciprocal working of communal and individual
forces. It was thus a social process which brought
man to read his condition and fates in terms of nature, or
else to read nature in terms of his own condition and fates.
His own condition and fates were ideas that came to him
through a kind of social reflection; and nature grew “poetic”
only by reason of man’s social organization, which sprang
from consciousness of kind, took shape in consent, and has
begotten first the communal idea and then the idea of
humanity. Only the eye “which hath kept watch o’er man’s
mortality” can see the “poetic” side of nature; and even
man’s mortality is a fact which came home to him in this
poetic sense only when social organization had put the notion
of humanity before his mind. So much is said of being
“alone with nature” as a necessary condition for the enjoyment
of its poetic side, and for sympathy with it, that one
forgets what sympathy means. The social foundation is
now forgotten; without it, however, there would be no poet’s
solitary rapture at all. Sympathy of the poet at its highest
is only rising to a new pitch in the sense of kind; and
although the prayer of St. Francis<a id='r1162' /><a href='#f1162' class='c012'><sup>[1162]</sup></a> has been quoted nigh
unto death, one may be allowed to revive it, not merely
because of its wide sympathy, embracing “my brother, the
sun,” and all created things, but also because this sympathy
is the poetic expression of an idea which St. Francis put into
actual working on earth, in that community of brothers in
the bonds of divine and human love.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nature, however, and the fates of man are not always so
stupendous or so abstract in their relations. There is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>close, familiar tie, now cheery in its kind, and now sad, in
the coming and going of the seasons. How much of modern
poetry is bound up with this simple and obvious motive; and
how easily one finds here the connection between new song
and old! In a preceding chapter it was the difference we
sought; here it is the identity, not merely of rhythm, but of
imaginative force. Much has been said of that lyric appeal
to the season and to the scene with which rude songs of the
dance, and, later, actual ballads, were wont to begin: <i>Sumer
ys ycumen in</i>, and <i>Lenten is comen with Love to toune</i>, are
fossil bits of English verse in this kind. So, too, as the
coming season was welcomed, the parting season had its
lyric regret. What more is done by the most imaginative
poem of our day, than to revive in the solitary reader that
immediate delight or sorrow of the singing and dancing
throng? When one says that the poet ennobles this actual
scene, and adds something which was not present in sunshine
and woods and waters and green earth, not even in the song
of the birds, what else does one mean but that the poet has
brought these things under the spell of human emotion, precisely
as the human emotion of the dancers mingled with the
scene of their festivity? Nothing is more common in folksong
than lament for wintry desolation, for the silence and
absence of the birds. Walther von der Vogelweide touches
the old motive and the old cadence with slight but graceful
art; and it is “I” instead of “we,” although the communal
emotion is not far away. Then comes the full power of
imagination in a certain sonnet, and in a certain line of it:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Bare, ruin’d choirs where late the sweet birds sang.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Take away the “ruin’d choirs,” and of course one takes away
Shakspere; but there is another alternative. Take away
the older festal throngs of summer, the sorrowing throngs at
its close; take away that cadence of consenting feet which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>echoes in the verse; take away the human sympathy which
was so fostered by this consent,—and those “ruin’d choirs”
are left as purposeless and idle as the void of space.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, with other forms of imagination in poetry. Nature
apart, and on themes as abstract as one will, great artistic
poetry is still powerless to sever its connection with this communal
imagination of sympathy and consent. Some of the
strong passages in later poetry derive their energy from
despair. “Man’s one crime,” says the Spaniard, “is to have
been born;” while between Fitzgerald and the tentmaker lies
the credit for that verse which bids God take as well as
give pardon for the wickedness of mankind. This is called
sublime. When the savage beats and breaks his gods, or
reviles them in reiterated verse, he is called silly; but perhaps
his disillusions, put into choral statement, may bring
him something of that grim comfort which civilized man
finds in a rhythmic defiance not absolutely different in kind.
Nor, again, was the passing of a god, or of a system of gods,
the same thing for communal chorus with those mounting
races in the prime, as with these belated and stunted hordes.
Defiance, however, apart, on the positive religious side choral
praise is still a fact; and choral comment on the ways of God
with man, that enthusiasm for which imagination is only a
substitute, that <i>sursum corda</i> of congregational singing, that
lapse of the individual and that triumph of the community,
are enough to check one’s impulse to think of early communal
singing in terms of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera. It is hard,
indeed, to pass back from conditions of solitary and artistic
imagination to conditions of communal imagination; but the
process is not impossible. If one will simply open a Shakspere
and read aloud the passage where Ophelia tells her
father how Hamlet came to her closet and bade her that
silent farewell; the praise of friendship chanted so finely by
Hamlet to Horatio; the parting at dawn of Romeo and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>Juliet; the declaration of Portia;<a id='r1163' /><a href='#f1163' class='c012'><sup>[1163]</sup></a> the last speech of Othello;
Macbeth arming for the final fight; Prospero at the end of
the mask: familiar as these all are, the mere series of impressions
will give one a new sense of the varied creative power
to be found in a single field of poetry. Then, with all this
ringing in one’s ears, let one read aloud the shorter version
of <i>Sir Patrick Spens</i>, and compare its imaginative range with
the imaginative range of Shakspere. Neither simplicity
alone, nor the change from drama to ballad, will cover this
difference.<a id='r1164' /><a href='#f1164' class='c012'><sup>[1164]</sup></a> The strongest differencing element is the antithesis
of individual artistic imagination in widest range, and
of sympathy concentrated upon a small, but compact group.
It is a step from the great world to a little canton, from
humanity to a clan; spaces have shrunk, and sympathy almost
lies in that actual touch of hand and hand, which once did for
primitive poetry what imagination now does for the poet. At
the heart of them both, however, drama and ballad, is this
sympathy and consent of kind. True, the ballad is late and
has its share of art; but the line drawn to it from the drama
is a curve to be projected into prehistoric conditions, and
able to connect the crude sympathy of kind expressed in
choral repetition with noblest imaginative achievements of
the perfected art.</p>

<p class='c013'>To create the communal elements, poetry had to pass
through ages of preparation. Dreary ages they seem now,
and rudest preparation, in contrast with present verse; but
it may be said that the poetry was not insipid for its makers
and hearers, and the art was not crude for the primitive
artists. One must ignore with equal mind the romantic
notion of a paradise of poetry at the prime, as well as a too
fondly cherished idea of ethnology that belated if not degraded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>wanderers on the bypaths of human culture are to stand as
models for the earliest makers of song. Let one think of
that poetry of the beginnings as rude to a degree, but nobly
rude, seeing that it was big with promise of future achievement,
and not a thing born of mere stagnation. Circling in
the common dance, moving and singing in the consent of
common labour, the makers of earliest poetry put into it
those elements without which it cannot thrive now. They
put into it, for the formal side, the consent of rhythm, outward
sign of the social sense; and, for the nobler mood, they
gave it that power by which it will always make the last
appeal to man, the power of human sympathy, whether in
love or in hate, in joy or in sorrow, the power that links this
group of sensations, passions, hopes, fears, which one calls
self, to all the host of kindred selves dead, living, or to be
born. No poetry worthy of the name has failed to owe its
most diverse triumphs to that abiding power. It is in such
a sense that prehistoric art must have been one and the same
with modern art. Conditions of production as well as of
record have changed; the solitary poet has taken the place
of a choral throng, and solitary readers represent the listening
group; but the fact of poetry itself reaches below all
these mutations, and is founded on human sympathy as on
a rock. More than this. It is clear from the study of poetic
beginnings that poetry in its larger sense is not a natural
impulse of man simply as man. His rhythmic and kindred
instincts, latent in the solitary state, found free play only
under communal conditions, and as powerful factors in the
making of society.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Criticism has been treated of late with scientific precision. See the bibliographical
array in Gayley and Scott’s admirable <i>Methods and Materials of Literary
Criticism</i>, Boston, 1899. From the imperial critic, the “gentle reader” and patron
represented by Montaigne, who gives no reasons but his own likes and dislikes,
as witness that delightful essay on books, in its opening sentence, through the
official critics, down to M. Brunetière, the scientific critic, faithful to the doctrine
of evolution in general, and attentive to the law in the particular case, it is to be
noted how criticism has been approaching the sociological domain, the study of
poetry as an element of human life. Sainte-Beuve was still a critic of poets and
poems, for all his “natural method”; Taine crossed the border and studied
poetry, the product, under sociological and ethnological conditions. See Sainte-Beuve,
<i>Nouveaux Lundis</i>, VIII. 87 f., 69 f.; IX. 70; and Taine, <i>Derniers Essais</i>,
Paris, 1894, pp. 58 f. M. Brunetière, in carrying on the plan of Taine, and Hennequin,
in opposing it, work on sociological and historical ground, rather than in
the old æsthetics. Hennequin’s <i>Critique</i> is “scientifique”; while a title like
M. Brunetière’s <i>Evolution of Species in Literature</i> can be conceded to criticism
only by taking such liberties with the word as to leave it practically undefined.
Still, these men work for criticism if not in it, and they give no reason for disputing
what is said in the text about the paucity of books on poetry as an element in
human society. They have the modern poet, the modern poem, in view; they
wish to lay down metes and bounds and adjust the law. Hennequin will found a
new science, “an immense anthropology,” made up of all the vital sciences
(<i>Crit. Sci.</i>, pp. 185 f.); but his place is with the critics, and not with scholars in
historical and comparative literature. His <i>æsthopsychology</i> indicates devotion to
the poetic impulse rather than to the product. Mr. Granger (<i>Worship of the
Romans</i>, p. vii) has lately called up the word <i>ethology</i>, suggested by Stuart Mill
(<i>Logic of the Moral Sciences</i>, pp. 213 ff., 218), in line with a hint that the foundations
of comparative psychology must be laid in the study of the people and of
their habits of thought. Something of this sort has been done by M. Le Bon in
his <i>Psychologie des Foules</i>, quoted below.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Such are the <i>Comparative Literature</i> of Posnett, and the less didactic work
of Letourneau, <i>L’Évolution Littéraire dans les diverses Races Humaines</i>, Paris,
1894. The former was mainly pioneer work, meant to open and define its subject;
and in this it attained its end. This sociological method has been applied,
of course, in a critical way, to many individual works, and to many periods of
literature; not so, however, with the poetic product at large.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is more to be said for the partial origin of poetry in choral songs of a
sexual character sung after the communal feast of the horde or clan. This “sex-freedom,”
so revolting to modern ideas, left late traces in history; and Professor
Karl Pearson quotes Tsakni’s <i>La Russie Sectaire</i> to the effect that such license
still prevails at fairs and periodic festivals in Russia, combined with choral dance.—Pearson,
<i>The Chances of Death</i>, II. 243. There are Australian festivals of this
sort; and license of May-Day, of Shrove-Tuesday, and the rest, is familiar in
European survival. On the other hand, it will be found that erotic poetry of the
individual and lyric sort is almost unknown among savages.</p>

child’s weeping “a song of lament,” and its laughter “a song of joy.” “Every
passion,” he says, “<i>has its own tone with which it makes itself manifest</i>,” really
a better hint of origins than this scientific masquerading of Jacobowski.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r26'>26</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The best objection against this analogy in any definite use is made by
O. Gruppe, <i>Griechische Culte und Mythen</i>, p. 199. The child and the savage, he
points out, have each a small range of perceptions; the ways in which they
enlarge this range are diametrically opposed. One does it productively; the
other, receptively. See, too, a bit of sarcasm over the complacent scorn for the
“childish” savages felt by civilized man, Grosse, <i>Anfänge der Kunst</i>, pp. 51 f.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r27'>27</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dr. Brown, Adam Smith, Lord Monboddo, and others were leading Englishmen
in the movement to use the savage to explain early man. Smith and Monboddo
enjoyed this literary vivisection, the former once watching “a negro dance
to his own song the war-dance of his own country, with such vehemence of action
and expression, that the whole company, gentlemen as well as ladies, got up upon
chairs and tables.” See the <i>Essays</i>, Edinburgh, 1795, “Of the Imitative Arts,”
Parts II., III., and the fragment “Of the Affinity between Music, Dancing, and
Poetry.” The main credit, however, belongs to Turgot. In his “Plan du Prém.
Disc. sur l’Hist. Universelle,” <i>Œuvres</i>, II. 216, he uses the savages of America
to illustrate the state of primitive man. He is also strong for the <i>milieu</i>. “Si
Racine fût né au Canada chez les Hurons...!” he says, II. 264; and his
other illustrations are suggestive (in the “Plan du 2. Disc.”). II. 265, he notes
the homogeneity of barbaric races.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r29'>29</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The outright degeneration assumed by Le Maistre need not come into the
account. Human progress is now conceded to be a resultant of opposing forces
of growth and decay. Mr. Talcott Williams has an interesting paper, “Was
Primitive Man a Modern Savage?” in the <i>Report of the Smithsonian Inst.</i>, 1896,
pp. 541 ff. His main point is, that the modern savage has deteriorated under pressure.
Primitive man was in a more or less “empty earth,” and was not crowded
by his fellows. The god of war is always a junior member of Olympus. So, too,
Professor Baldwin (<i>Social and Ethical Interpretations</i>, p. 214) argues for a reign
of peace, a “sort of organic resting-place,” in the child’s second period, which
answers to social coöperation, “the rest which man took after his release from
the animal.... The social tide then sets in. The quest of domestic union and
reciprocal service comes to comfort him, and his nomadic and agricultural habits
are formed.” One is reminded of Scherer’s argument for an epoch of peace in
early Germanic culture attested by names which bear that stamp as compared
with the later and warlike Gerhards, Gertrudes, and the rest.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r30'>30</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is hardly necessary to warn against fallacies of illustration. Even Bruchmann
goes astray when he says the poem of Goethe is to the primitive song as a
cherry tree in bloom is to a cherry stone just planted. To primitive man the
primitive song was already a tree in bloom, and his appreciation of it was in line
with modern appreciation of Goethe’s poem.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r31'>31</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or, indeed, any one tribe of human beings. Even in the very beginning
of human activity, that activity was, as now, conditioned by the environment,
and there were doubtless several types of primitive existence. Evidently, then,
there could have been different types of social union even at the outset of social
progress.</p>

not a perfect one.” Verse “is necessary to the perfection of all
poetry that admits of it,”—and how, pray, is that limitation to be adjusted?

or “words without music.” See Twining’s fourth note.—It has been pointed out
that nowhere in the fragment does Aristotle essay a formal definition of poetry.</p>

in some highly sensible remarks by Mr. A. O. Prickard in a lecture, <i>Aristotle
and the Art of Poetry</i>, London, 1891. What Aristotle clearly meant to say is that
“metre is not the most essential characteristic of poetry, <i>yet it would be a misuse
of language to call anything a poem which is not metrical in form</i>.” (Italics not
in original, p. 60.) Mr. Prickard agrees with Whately, Twining, and many
others, that the words of the passage in question, and the instances given, do not
make against this view; and “elsewhere, Plato and Aristotle invariably assume
that only what is metrical is to be called poetry; nay, that metrical writing and
poetry are, for the common purpose of language, convertible terms. ‘In metre,
as a poet,’ says Plato, ‘or without metre as a layman.’ ‘A good sentence,’ says
Aristotle, ‘should have rhythm but not metre; if it have metre, it will be a poem.’”

1741-1752. See I. 2 ff. Quadrio is outright for the test of verse and for a generous
rendering of Aristotle. He gives the names of forgotten pleaders on both
sides, and thinks the noes have it against a traditional Aristotelian view; not to
quarrel forever, “Basta, che nacque la Poesia col Verso e col Canto: né, propagata
fra le nazioni, fu altrimenti mai lavorato che in Verso.”—Spingarn, <i>Literary
Criticism in the Renaissance</i>, New York, 1899, pp. 9 ff., points out that Mantuan
was for the verse-test, Savonarola, Minturno, Daniello, against it.</p>

The rest is instructive. Borinski, to be sure, <i>Poetik d. Renaissance</i>, p. 66, says
that Casaubon wished to call Herodotus a poet; but a detached phrase of this
sort—compare Scaliger’s epic in prose—goes for little when it fails to force the
barrier and break down the writer’s definition. Dryden, on the other hand,
making “invention” the sole test of poetry, clashes badly with his opinion

poetry.”</p>

may grow as long as their tresses. With such a ritual act goes nearly always a
song, a repeated shout, a cry to the powers of growth; and this, if one please, is
poetry in its making, while it is easy to think that the symbol would sooner or
later force itself into the words—“make our flax like this hair.”</p>

of the golden style of certain despised folk who wrote cadenced and coloured
prose in their romances three centuries ago. And not only in romances;
Tom Nash tried rimed prose, both with alliteration and with actual rime, by way
of helping the antithetical clause. See the “Anatomy of Absurdity,” in Nash’s
<i>Works</i>, ed. Grosart, I. 6 ff., 24: inferre: averre; praise: daies; nose: rose: and
the lilt of “to play with her dogge, than to pray to her God.” The <i>Arcadia</i> is
not so much a rimed or rhythmical prose, as swelling and sonorous. For mediæval
rimed prose, see Wackernagel, <i>Gesch. d. deutsch. Lit.</i>, 2d ed., I. 107 ff., and

Tennyson read his own verses almost in a chant. De Vigny, <i>Journal d’un Poete</i>,

Ronsard, <i>Œuvres</i>, ed. Blanchemain, III. 12 f., asks the reader of his <i>Franciade</i>
one thing: “Be good enough to pronounce my verses well, and suit your voice
to their emotion, not reading it, after the way of certain folk, as a letter, ...
but as a poem, with good emphasis.” So Quintilian; but the elocutionist has

reason, emotion, and imagination of a poet, and gives a genetic process not unlike
that set forth by Mr. Spencer: “denn aus betonter, gemessener recitation der
Worte entsprangen gesang und lied, aus dem lied die andere dichtkunst, aus dem

charms or incantations, and form the basis of the common antithesis of “say”
and “sing” (p. 258). The epic part of a charm, he thinks, was recited, while
the lyric part was sung. Unfortunately, Schröder comes to no very definite

speak like other men, or else they will be laugh’t at. ’Tis ridiculous to speak, or
write, or preach in verse.” Again, “’Tis ridiculous for a Lord to print verses, ’tis
well enough to make them to please himself, but to make them publick is foolish.
If a man in his private chamber twirls his bandstrings, or plays with a rush to
please himself, ’tis well enough; but if he should go into Fleet Street,”—and so
on. He thinks there is no reason why plays should be in verse; but he rescues
the old poets who were forced to write verse “because their verse was sung to
music.”</p>

the value for general purposes from Dr. Otto Hoffman’s otherwise praiseworthy
study of the <i>Reimformeln im Westgermanischen</i> (Leipzig, 1886, pp. 9 ff.). Man,
he says, naturally speaks in breath-lengths, in periods which tend to be of equal
duration. “Whoever could give to these periods, with their tendency to equal
quantities, the most symmetrical and equal portions of actual speech, passed for
an artist.” To this symmetry in duration was added similarity of sound; so came
the short riming phrases, as well as the verse-lengths themselves. But poetry
did not wait until clever artists furbished up into verse-lengths and attractive harmonies
these breath-lengths of a spoken sentence. Language itself, as one will
presently see, had more a festal than an individual origin; and long before the
artist was practising his breath-lengths for a connected story, the rhythm of verse
was fixed by the muscular rhythm of steps in a communal dance accompanied by
words, often by one sound, repeated indefinitely, but in exact cadence with the steps.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r229'>229</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The theory of breath-lengths, often noted, comes here into play. Under high
excitement breathing grows abnormally loud, and the recurring pauses are regular.
Play-excitement, festal shouting and leaping, would of course bring this about;
but the individual must be studied. Strongly accented verses result from such a
process, as any one can see who undertakes to recite poetry during violent but
regular exercise,—say, in swinging Indian clubs. Here, too, one learns how
rhythm preceded pitch and quantity; the jerked-out accents leave little room for
measuring either height or length of tones. But the throng and its consent
brought out this rhythm, not oratory; and one must keep in mind the remark of
Hamann, after his famous phrase about poetry as the mother-tongue of man,
“wie Gesang älter als Declamation.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f230'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r230'>230</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The ethnological evidence for this statement is given in Wallaschek’s <i>Primitive
Music</i> on nearly every page. Many good things on the origin of rhythm
could be quoted from older writers. A. W. Schlegel undertook a physiological
and genetic study of rhythm, but, at Schiller’s prompting, offered more attractive
metal to the Kantlings with “das Beharrliche im Wechsel.” One notes, however,
the modern tone of passages in the Berlin Lectures; <i>e.g.</i> I. 242 ff. Now
and then he almost anticipates Bücher’s <i>Arbeit und Rhythmus</i>. Sulzer’s article
in the <i>Allgemeine Theorie</i> is very interesting. For early material, see Blankenburg’s
invaluable <i>Litterarische Zusätze</i>, 3 vols., 1796-1798. A good recent discussion
is found in the third book of Guyau’s <i>Problèmes</i>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f232'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r232'>232</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Compare the “meaningless” words so common in savage poetry. The art
of combining with exact rhythm a series of syntactic sentences which give a
connected story, or express a logical series of thoughts, is no primitive process.
Earliest poetry is repetition of sounds,—not meaningless, for they were connected
with the occasion,—of words, of sentences, with a diminishing use of the refrain,
a diminishing frequency of repetition.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r233'>233</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In his “Art of the Future,” <i>Gesammelte Schriften</i>, III. 82 ff., he tells how
dance, song, and poem were at first inseparable. Dance has as artistic material
“the whole man from top to toe”; but it becomes an art only through rhythm,
which is also the very skeleton of music: “without rhythm no dance, no song.”
Rhythm is “the soul of dancing and the brain of music.” With the human
voice comes poetry, all three being woven in one: out of this union of the three
“is born the single art of lyric,” but they get their highest expression in the
drama.</p>

by the Ba-Ronga of Delagoa Bay (Junod, <i>Les Chantes et les Contes des Ba-Ronga</i>,
Lausanne, 1897), where the use of sticks may help to explain Donovan’s
“rhythmic beating.” With these people “tout s’y chante et ... tous ou presque
tous les chants s’y dansent” (p. 21). Refrains are sung “ten, twenty, fifty
times in succession”; the songs have two elements, the solo and the refrain <i>en
tutti</i>. A circle is formed, the men holding sticks in their hands; the solo singer
leaps into the middle and sings a few words; then all the dancers sing a refrain,
raising and dropping their sticks in cadence, though the rhythm is primarily given
by their stamping feet. Then the soloist again, only slightly varying his theme;
and again the long refrain (pp. 32 f.). The war-songs are almost entirely refrain,
sung by all the warriors as they dance, “antique et grandiose choral,” says Junod.</p>

have been modified. In the second edition of the <i>Entstehung der Volkswirthschaft</i>,

<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r246'>246</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A strong support for this social foundation of song is found in observations
such as Böckel has made among the peasants of Hesse. “Their song,” he says
(work quoted, p. cv.), “is nearly all choral; the countryman, when sober, seldom
sings alone. It is remarkable,” Böckel goes on to say, “how these people, who
singly show little capacity for music, can make such an artistic effect in chorus.”</p>

poetry of the people, as toward a fictitious and fanciful affair, is largely due to a
misunderstanding of the evolutionary side of the case. The distinction is not one
of coexistent forms of poetry so much as of successive stages of evolution. It is
no hard matter to take so-called popular poetry of the day and reduce it to terms
of art—the lowest terms, of course; but with poetry of the people treated as a
closed or closing account, and with historical evidence about it in former times, a
very different problem is presented. An important hint to this effect was given by
Dr. Eugen Wolff in his paper “über den Stil des Nibelungenliedes,” <i>Verhandlungen

of great value, which shows how utterly German folksong is a closed account.
Traditional ballads are still sung, but none are made; what is now made is mainly
“Schmutz und Rohheit.” Factories, singing-schools, are putting an end to communal
song. The process of decay, he thinks, began as early as 1600. For

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f369'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r369'>369</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This traditional, narrative song is called ballad throughout the present book,—unfortunately
an equivocal term. The terminology of the whole subject is
notoriously bad, and “ballad” is no exception to the rule. See <i>Old English Ballads</i>,
pp. xviii ff.; Blankenburg, <i>Litterarische Zusätze u. s. w.</i>, I. 387 ff., under
“Dichtkunst”; for modern “ballad,” Werner in the <i>Anzeiger für deutsches Alterthum</i>,
XIV. 165 ff., 190 f., XV. 259; for German names, Erich Schmidt, <i>Charakteristiken</i>,
pp. 199 ff.; on <i>balada</i>, Jeanroy, <i>Origines</i>, etc., p. 403, who shows the
passage of the word from its meaning as a dance-song to the technical term for a
fixed form of verse. In Corsica a <i>ballata</i> can be a lament (see below under
<i>vocero</i>), and derives from the dance round a corpse: J. B. Marcaggi, <i>Les Chants
de la Mort</i>, etc., Paris, 1898, p. 121, note on the <i>caracolu</i>, “a sort of pantomime
danced about the corpse by the mourning women, with gestures of grief,” but now
fallen out of use. Of course, the only point here is to separate the ballad from
songs like <i>Greensleeves</i>, from journalism (for the so-called “ballad” under Elizabeth
shows that her folk were as anxious to get into print, or to keep out of it, as
we are in days of the newspaper), from occasional poetry, scurrilous rimes, hymns,
and all the rest. “Sonnet” was a word that then not only meant any short poem,
but occasionally made a little competition with “ballad”; several of the ballads in
the Rawlinson Collection, Bodleian Library, are called “sonnet” either by title or
in the text.</p>

Middle Ages—beginning, say, with the eleventh century—which passed from the
“Romanic-Germanic centre of Europe” into various tongues, was delivered to
oral tradition as popular verse, spread and flourished down to the sixteenth century,
where it was collected as <i>romancero</i>, <i>romanze</i>, <i>kæmpevise</i>, ballad. But

<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r385'>385</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even in the material itself there is a shading from highly artistic down to
communal. <i>Thomas Rymer</i> undoubtedly comes from a romance. <i>The Boy and
the Mantle</i> has the flippancy of its origin in the <i>fabliau</i>; Jeanroy, <i>Origines</i>, p. 155,
declares such a touch of the cynical to warrant one in taking the ballad out of that
class which he calls popular. <i>King Orfeo</i> is a distorted tale from the classics.
Plain kin-tragedies, however, like <i>Babylon</i>, <i>Edward</i>, <i>The Twa Brothers</i>, are
simple enough for one to leave them to communal origins, and not go source-hunting.
Even where the motive seems international, details may be home-made;
how much of <i>Hero and Leander</i> is left in that Westphalian ballad, <i>Et wasen twei
Kunnigeskinner</i>? This story of the lovers and the lighted taper is found in many
folksongs. See Reifferscheid, <i>Westfälische Volkslieder</i>, pp. 127 ff. In the classics
and modern poetry,—witness Musæos and Marlowe,—it belongs to art. Comparative
mythology laid hold of it, followed it back to India, and from India to
the skies,—spring-god, sea, stars, autumn storms, and the rest. But this is
needless bewilderment of a plain case; we have only to deal with the way in which
Westphalian peasants sing of prince and princess. In three stanzas the story is
told; all the rest deals with the situation so given, and here the communal elements
(see below, p. <a href='#Page_196'>196</a>) come in. The point is that study of subject-matter in ballads
is distinct from the study of ballad elements. These are constant in good ballads,
whether the subject be borrowed, or be local history, as in <i>Bessy Bell and Mary
Gray</i>, and the Border ballads generally. In addition to the studies of ballad
migration (e.g. <i>Sir Aldingar</i>) by Grundtvig and by Child, see a close piece of
investigation by Professor Bugge, “Harpens Kraft,” in the <i>Arkiv for Nordisk
Filologi</i>, VII. (1891), 97 ff.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r417'>417</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was noted that the Botocudos had no legends, no song of the past. A narrative
song in the legendary sense is unknown to primitive folk; what they sing is
the event of the day, an improvised song of sentences almost contemporary with
the facts, cadenced by the communal dance. The sense of time past is so slender
even among North American Indians (Powell, First Annual Report of Bureau of
Ethnology to Smithsonian Inst., 1881, pp. 29 ff.), that while they admit that grass
grows, they “stoutly deny that the forest pines and the great sequoias were not
created as they are.” Now this primitive trait of poetry is preserved in communal
ballads; and from this strictly communal class, long historical ballads, like
those in German collections, should be excluded. Kögel, <i>Geschichte der deutschen
Litteratur</i>, I. 111, notes that “the epic song ... is one of the later kinds of
poetry.... It cannot even be regarded as belonging to the common Germanic
stock.” But the communal narrative song is another matter.</p>

triads, at the end of a French ballad, “Sur le Bord de l’Ile,” Crane, <i>Chansons

noted, of the Hero and Leander story: Reifferscheid, <i>Westf. Volksl.</i>, pp. 2 f.;
see <i>ibid.</i>, Nos. 2, 5. “Mother, my <i>eyes</i> hurt me,—may I <i>walk</i> by the sea?”—“Not
alone; take thy youngest brother.” Reasons follow against and for this.
Then repetition: my <i>eyes</i> hurt me, may I not <i>walk</i>, etc. “Take thy youngest

<i>de Poesi Fennica</i> 1778, pp. 57 ff. He begins by lamenting the decay
of old national song near the coast and under clerical influence; intimates that
song was a universal gift and was improvised, although sundry bards are now eminent.
Memorable events slip into song, now convivial, now satiric; and there is
great store of proverbs. The description of dual singing begins with § XI.</p>

afflatu moti stantes carmen ordiantur, mox tamen, conjunctis dextris sessum
eunt, et ritu solito cantandi continuant operam.” They observe the rules of the
game. Porthan, to be sure, notes the absence of dancing as a national and pervasive
affair; but the statement must not go unchallenged. Long before this,
Olaus Magnus (<i>Hist. de gentibus Septentrion.</i>, Romæ, 1555, Cap. VIII. lib. IV.
141) said of the Lappland and other northern folk that they were often moved
to dance,—“excitentur ad saltum, quem vehementius citharoedo sonante ducentes,
veterumque heroum ac gigantum præclara gesta patrio rhytmate et carmine
canentes, in gemitus et alta suspiria, hinc luctus et ululatum resoluti, dimisso
ordine in terram ruunt,” a parlous state. Scheffer, to be sure, discredits this
statement of the archbishop (<i>Lapponia</i>, 1673, p. 292); but Donner, <i>Lieder der
Lappen</i>, p. 38, believes it, and says it is confirmed by the report of a recent Russian
traveller.</p>

“per totam noctem cantabantur hic nefaria, et <i>cantantibus saltabatur</i>.” See also
the well-known passage from Burchard of Worms: “cantasti ibi diabolica carmina
et fecisti ibi saltationes”—<i>i.e.</i> at the “vigiliis cadaverum mortuorum.”
Müllenhoff, work quoted, pp. 26 ff., gives some of these protests of the church.
On p. 30 he notes that the songs themselves were improvised: <i>extempore et subito
facta</i>. The older the rite, the more choral and communal it grows. The names
(<i>ibid.</i>, p. 25) are significant: <i>dâdsisas</i>, <i>leidsang</i>, <i>chlagasang</i>, etc., for older German;
<i>lîcsang</i>, <i>lîcleóð</i> (<i>epicedium</i>), <i>byrgensang</i> (<i>epitaphium</i>), etc., for older English.</p>

It is superfluous to point out how English lyric poetry, from the <i>Ruin</i> to the <i>Elegy</i>,

the heart that it was forbidden by government; its refrain, <i>Woe is me, Alhama</i>,

224 ff., and “Die Wiederholung als Urform der Dichtung bei Goethe,” <i>ibid.</i>, IV.
267 ff.,—traces the development of poetical style from this fundamental fact of
repetition. First, simple words were repeated, then only part of the words in a
sentence: such is the case in old Chinese, in Zend, in Accadian. Then came
parallelism; then the repetition of similar sounds; <i>and finally metre or rhythm</i>
(<i>Versmass</i>). Where were the dancing throngs in this interesting stretch of development,
with rhythm as an afterclap of rime? As later in his review of Bücher’s
<i>Arbeit und Rhythmus</i>, so here, Biedermann denies that rhythm came into poetry
through music and the dance. He fails, however, to make good this assertion by
any show of proof (see above, p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>); but his references are useful for the student
of repetition. For another scheme of repetition in poetry, see R. M. Meyer, <i>Altgermanische

conditions and circumstances of this hymn with those of the old German hymns,
of which we have no example; he therefore infers for the latter the same repeated
cries to the god, and finds confirmation for this inference in the dancing, the
repetitions and the cries of a Gothic Christmas play, written in Latin, in Greek
characters, but with a Gothic original peeping through. Müller’s attempt to
restore this Latin-Gothic hymn is highly interesting.</p>

<p class='c013'>then plucked, washed, dried, and so on. The list of these songs could be
extended indefinitely; the fact that this of the salad is sung at a quite alien festivity
simply proves the vogue of the thing. One must refer, however, to the
dances of Catalonian peasants and children, the songs for which are little more
than repetition and refrain descriptive of country toil, as quoted by Wolf,
pp. 34 f., of his <i>Proben Portugiesischer und Catalanischer Volksromanzen</i>, Wien,

Drake connected <i>hooky</i> with <i>hockey</i>, the hock or harvest cart sung by Herrick.
But perhaps “hooky” is to be kept without any such change. Leyden, see <i>Complaynte
of Scotland</i>, p. xciii, speaking of ring dances at the <i>kirn</i> or feast of cutting
down the grain, says that reapers who first finished the work danced on an eminence,
in view of other reapers, and began the dance “with three loud shouts of
triumph, and <i>thrice tossing up their hooks in the air</i>.” Cf. the Oxford Dict., s.v.

<i>Mythologische Forschungen</i>, already quoted; Pfannenschmid, <i>Germanische Erntefeste</i>,
Hannover, 1878; and, pioneer of them all, Tylor’s admirable work on
<i>Primitive Culture</i>. For children’s games, as last refuge of many of these rites,
see F. M. Böhme, <i>Deutsches Kinderlied u. Kinderspiel</i>, Leipzig, 1897, which could
be enlarged by a judicious use of Firmenich, <i>Germaniens Völkerstimmen</i>, in four
volumes. Böhme says the <i>Ringelreihen</i> of these games are “uralte Reste chorischer
Aufführungen bei den Jahres-und Gottesfesten unserer heidnischen Vorfahren,”
and gives cases which support his statement. Processional songs of the old
cult survive in the <i>Ansingelieder</i>, <i>Umzugslieder</i>, and so forth, of the children,
now mainly begging-rimes like the wren-song in Ireland and England, parallel
to the swallow-song in Rhodes. Again, children have games which imitate sounds
and movements of labour; Böhme gives a few. See also G. F. Northall, <i>English
Folk-Rhymes</i>, pp. 360 ff. Halliwell, of course, includes some of these in his
nursery-rimes. See also W. W. Newell, <i>Games and Songs of American Children</i>,
N. Y., 1883. These songs of the children would lead us too far a-field, and we
shall cling to the scanty survivals of the songs and refrains of labour itself.</p>

communal farmer occurs in old English novels, and in some new ones; but he is
passing rapidly into tradition. See a paper on “England’s Peasantry,” by the
Rev. Dr. Jessopp, in the <i>Nineteenth Century and After</i>, January, 1901; he tells
of the communal conditions which once prevailed, of the change to the present,
and is “inclined to doubt seriously whether before another century has ended
there will be any such thing as an agricultural labourer to know.”</p>

end, despite the other failing powers. See Beaurepaire’s valuable testimony to
this fact, <i>Étude</i>, pp. 39 ff., 48 f. “Deux lignes au plus composent le couplet. Le
refrain est vraiment la partie importante, il supplie à la pauvreté ou à l’absence de
la rime.... Au reste, il ne faudrait pas s’y tromper, la longueur du refrain, et son
retour continuel, que nous serions tenté de considerer comme un défaut, forme précisement
un des plus sûrs moyens du succès de la Chanson de Filasse. Elle exige,
en effet, peu d’efforts de mémoire, elle permet à tous les laboureurs de prendre
part fréquemment au chant; et avec son allure monotone, elle s’adapte merveilleusement
à la marche lente et reguliere de travaux de la campagne. Aussi
croyons-nous que c’est en partie à la predominance du refrain, que la chanson
cuellissoire doit sa vogue et sa popularité.” He gives another song with a refrain

and with a refrain sung by dancing maidens. The <i>dodola</i>, a girl otherwise naked,
but entirely covered with grass, weeds, and flowers, goes with a retinue of maidens
from house to house; before each house the girls form a dancing ring with the
<i>dodola</i> in the middle. The woman of the house pours water over the <i>dodola</i>, while
she dances and turns about; the other maidens now sing the song for rain, each
line ending with the refrain, <i>oj dodo oj dodo le!</i> See Grimm, <i>Mythologie</i>⁴, p. 494.
Similar customs prevail in Greece; the song is here full of repetitions. See
Grimm, <i>Kl. Schr.</i>, II. 447. In the <i>Athenæum</i>, No. 2857 (1882), G. L. Gomme

hymns (p. 112), but adds a plea for the antiquity of folksong, which is “von

of poetry of the people as a statement of contemporaneous events in one sentence—hence
not “invented”—which is sung by the throng. He notes the increased
power of the refrain with the preponderance of lyric over epic elements: though
he neglects the dance and communal conditions generally. The close connection
of Goethe (as in the <i>Ach neige, Du Schmerzensreiche</i>) and of Rückert (as in the

that the refrains preserved in old French lyric poetry are actual “popular” songs,
or fragments of them; but he willingly accepts the theory that all refrains were

manner, one part of the dancers sang one verse, and another part, like strophe and
antistrophe, repeated the verse with a slight change, usually in the final word
which rimes with the other final word. The connection of this with the <i>contrasto</i>
of lover and sweetheart, imitated in the dance, of debate, flyting, <i>tenso</i>, and the
like, would lead too far afield. See p. 207, and below, p. <a href='#Page_325'>325</a>.</p>

forms, like the rondel and so on, out of purely popular refrain and verse, is of distinct
value to the student of communal poetry. It completely refutes the claim of
superficial criticism, common enough of late, that ballad and folksong are merely
dregs of an older art, and that some pretty comparison, say a tramp in an old dress-coat,
solves the communal problem. As jaunty and insufferable a piece of comment

necessary to a ballad, but Steenstrup’s argument is convincing; out of 502 Scandinavian
ballads which he examined, not more than 20 lacked a refrain. The
ballads in Child’s collection point the same way, at least for the older and shorter
ballads; the <i>Gest</i>, of course, and others of that sort, as well as broadside copies,
have passed from the lyrical stage. But even these must go back to an earlier
song with a refrain. Of the two-line ballads, the older form, there are 31,
and of these only 7 lack the refrain in their present form. Of the 305 ballads
in the collection, 106 in at least one version show evidence of refrain or chorus,—more
than a third; while of some 1250 versions in all, about 300 have the refrain.
This count was made very carefully by Mr. C. H. Carter, of Haverford College.
Of course, Wolf had long since proved that the refrain is characteristic of all early
poetry in the vernacular, and played a leading part in popular verse everywhere,
from its first collection in the fifteenth century down to the present time. See his

“do nothing but sing <i>Hé</i> or <i>Het</i>! like a man cutting wood, with a movement of
the arm; and they dance a ‘round’ without holding one another or stirring from
one place, beating their feet upon the earth.” So, says Lescarbot, they make fires
and jump through them, like our French peasants on the eve of St. John, who
shout and dance the whole night. His fifteenth chapter, pp. 765 ff., is on <i>Danses

maids, hand in hand, is a <i>ronde</i>, to be sure, in form, but a society affair as well,
with full dress, complicated figures, and a “divine minstrel” for the music. However,
the vintage dance to the Linos song, described in the preceding verses, holds,
like our harvest refrains, an older fashion.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r880'>880</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The development of the dance into different kinds of poetry is foreshadowed
by many of the older writers, although the first really comparative treatment of the
subject must be assigned to A. W. Schlegel in the lectures at Berlin a century ago.
Herder has some valuable remarks on the subject in his early essay <i>Vom Geist der
ebräischen Poesie</i>, following, of course, many hints of Lowth. Two hundred years
ago, Burette, a really learned writer, drew up his “Mémoire pour servir à l’Histoire
de la Danse des Anciens,” published in the <i>Mém.</i>, Acad. of Inscript., etc., I.
93 ff., Paris, 1717. Movement and imitation caused the dance, which is “nearly
as old as man,” and sprang from joy. Cadence is the mainspring; avoid, he
says, Lucian’s prattle about the stars. Wedding, festival, vintage, harvest,—look
to these, says Burette, in quite modern spirit, for the origins of the dance. He
traces metres to the rhythm of songs sung by the dancers. Another article of
this writer investigates ball-playing, often combined with dance and song.
Another writer on the dance was John Spencer, D.D., master of Corpus Christi
College (1630-1693), the founder of the science of comparative religions; his
“Dissertatio de Saltandi Ritu,” is printed in the <i>Thesaurus Antiquitat. Sacrar.
complectens selectissima clarissimorum Virorum Opuscula in quibus Veterum
Hebraeorum Mores, Leges, etc., illustrantur</i>, Vol. XXXII., Venet., 1767. Spencer
studies the dance of the Hebrews, and his references are valuable; he is comparative,
and uses dances of modern Turks to illustrate his subject. Hebrews
got some of their festal dances from heathen,—the <i>saltationes promiscuas</i>; for
erotic dances he thinks to have been early and everywhere. For a man of his
date, he concludes very boldly “probabilius est, sacras choreas agendi morem, ex
antiquissimo gentium usu primitus oriundum,” and so came to the Hebrews. The
festal dances, where Jews bore about branches and sang a choral full of repetitions
and with a constant refrain, he compares with pagan affairs of the sort; the pæan
is compared with refrains like <i>Hallel</i> and <i>Hosannah</i>. In fine, this is sharp, clear,
comparative work, and good reading still. From Joannis Meursi <i>Orchestra sive
de Saltationibus Veterum</i> ... Lugd. Batav., 1618, not much is to be learned
except a list (alphabetical) of the old dances, with references to the classic passages.
Most of the articles are short, but the Pyrrhic Dance has twelve pages.
An early essay on dancing, with considerable scope for its time, is inserted in
Elyot’s <i>Governour</i>, edited by Croft, London, 1880, from the edition of 1531, I.
202 ff. Elyot seems to be the first Englishman who wrote about the art.</p>

Musik,” <i>Rundschau</i>, LXI. (1889), 63, remarks that a young finch brought up
alone will sing the song of its kind, “but never so beautifully as when a good
singer is put with him as teacher.” The concession is enough.</p>

Giddings, on hints of Mr. Spencer, has drawn a picture of solitary, primitive
man arguing a spirit from the phenomenon of his shadow and of the echo of his
voice. It may be pointed out that communal shouts and cries, echoed from the
rocks, would be more likely to rouse a belief in that horde of spirits with which
the primitive human horde thought itself surrounded. Early religion was social,
communal; individual meditation, a process of individual thought, was utterly subordinate
to communal thought. Even now superstition is a lingering “they say.”</p>

entirely by hunting; we know nothing so primitive, and while checked in culture,
these tribes are probably not degraded (32 f.). The statements in the text are
based on careful arrangement of the statistics, a very important point. See Mucke,
<i>Horde und Familie</i>, pp. 181 ff. Spencer describes the “small, simple aggregates,”
coöperating “with or without a regulating centre, for certain public ends,” of
which the “headless” kind must be regarded as the primitive type; and gives a
list of these not very different from the list of Grosse. <i>Prin. Soc.</i>, I. § 257.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r975'>975</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even Mr. Spencer points out that this is no bar to communal consent, <i>Sociology</i>,
I. 59; for the variability implies “smaller departure from primitive reflex
action ... lack of the re-representative emotions which hold the simpler ones in
check.” Bastian, too, has shown that in the formation of society out of individuals,
the social element as such, the social whole, must precede the element of social
individuality or of the individuality within the mass. This is what one gathers
from Bastian’s books in general; in one case, <i>Die Welt in ihren Spiegelungen
unter dem Wandel des Völkergedankens</i>, p. 413, he applies this idea to the priority
of social property as compared with individual property.</p>

war-songs like the Marseillaise, the <i>Ça ira</i>, and the fact that French literature as
a whole is averse from undue stress upon the individual and does not suffer, whatever
its other defects, from “too much ego in its cosmos.” Texte points out that
Jean-Jacques, Germanic by nature, noticed this trait in the French. “Le <i>je</i> ...
est presque aussi scrupuleusement banni de la scène française que des écrits de
Port-Royal, <i>et les passions humaines</i> ... <i>n’y parlent jamais que par on</i>.” How
contemptuously M. Brunetière, who has no superior in the appreciation of French
literature as a whole, speaks of that new personal note, set in fashion by Rousseau,
“most eloquent of lackeys!” See “La Littérature Personnelle,” in B.’s <i>Questions

evidence that all goes one way, <i>Primitive Music</i>, pp. 277 f. Another absurd
reaction against romantic ideas is to deny lyric propensity to primitive folk and
substitute an acute sense of “business.” So Norden, work quoted, I. 156, says
the prayer of early man was anything but a “lyrical outpouring”; it was “a contract
with deity, give and take.” But emotional fear and emotional thanks precede
any such shrewd rationalism as this, if psychology is to be regarded, let alone

really an amœbean form of verse, has but one stanza, and this of three lines; the

Improvisation, too, and presumably once in the village throng, lies at the foundation

das thut grämen</i>, with culmination in that exquisite poem, probably not improvised,
<i>Innsprück, ich muss dich lassen</i>. The ennobling process is interesting, and

formula for lyric as poetry plus music, <i>Aesthetik</i>, p. 628, with the laborious definition
in R. M. Werner’s <i>Lyrik und Lyriker</i>, Hamburg and Leipzig, 1890, p. 10, based
mainly on the subjective element. Confusion of form and conditions, which makes
lyric poetry one with music (see Döring, <i>Kunstlehre d. Aristoteles</i>, p. 88), with
inner meaning and purpose, has caused most of the trouble. In one sense the old
choral was the very foundation of lyric. The congregational psalm of the Hebrews
is lyric, and so is the solitary cry of the modern poet.</p>

<i>Sitzungsber. d. Kais. Acad. d. Wiss. zu Wien</i>, Bd. 137, pp. 18 ff.), where he puts
the ceremonies at the hearthstone, primitive ancestor-worship, as the real beginning
of epic song. The offering to an ancestor must have been made “with
music, prayer, and song.” Hence the epos. It is true that a lyric of this sort is
older than any epic,—the epic which Hegel pushed forward as earliest form of
poetry, just as the renaissance had put it above the drama in dignity,—and may
well have helped the later epic process. But the evidence of ethnology shows
that rude songs at the tribal dance, which refer to tribal doings, must be far older
than any ceremonies of the primitive <i>hausvater</i> at his family altar.</p>

of gesture-language”; they all have “the same expression on their
features,” and “the same inarticulate cries when excited by the same emotions.”
See also Tylor, <i>Early History of Mankind</i>, chapters on Gesture-Language; and
<i>American Antiquarian</i>, II. 219, G. Mallery on Indian Sign Language. This
universal validity of gesture is highly significant for the beginnings of poetry, for
the rude cries which precede language are probably of the same order as the
gestures. See Chap. II., Wundt’s <i>Völkerpsychologie</i>.</p>

From the <i>Kansas City Star</i>, date unfortunately lost, may be quoted an interview
with Hagenbeck, the lion-tamer. “We can’t see,” he said, “the expression of a
lion’s face, except of rage, but his companions can.... Did you ever see one
animal fail to understand another? I never saw such an instance.... I am
inclined to think that what we call mind-reading is mere survival here and there
of the lost sixth sense, which was probably common to primitive man, and which
animals possess to this day.” Mr. Hagenbeck could furnish an interesting supplement
to Darwin’s book <i>On the Expression of Emotions</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r1090'>1090</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As in dances of the Greeks, now felt to be a lost art. On this matter of
gesture and signs, see an excellent book by Sittl, <i>Die Gebärden der Griechen und
Römer</i>, Leipzig, 1890; his accounts of the attempt “die Völker durch die Zeichensprache
zu verbrüdern,” with reference to Leibnitz and others; of orgiastic
ecstasies; and, of course, the study of Greek gesture in art and poetry, are all
instructive. For primitive relations, Darwin’s book <i>On the Expressions of Emotions</i>,
etc., 1872, is still main authority. Gestures, like sounds, are either instinctive
or called out by the will; and any study of progress in the dramatic art must
concern itself with these fundamental elements of acting.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1091'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r1091'>1091</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It would be useless to attempt a bibliography of this subject. A. W. Schlegel’s
historical account of the drama and its relations to epic and lyric is still useful.
See especially <i>Vorles.</i>, I. 124; II. 317, 321, 325. Eugen Wolff’s return to the
priority of epic,—<i>Prolegomena</i>, etc., p. 10; “Vorstudien zur Poetik,” <i>Zst. f. vgl.
Litt.</i>, VI. 425,—fails to satisfy the student of ethnological evidence; like most
writers from the æsthetic point of view, Wolff neglects to study the poetry of the
throng, the choral, the dance. Barring this same fault, there is considerable truth
in the view of Burdach (letter to Scherer, in the latter’s <i>Poetik</i>, pp. 296 f.), that
epic and drama are wrongly taken as extreme antithesis in poetry, whereas lyric
and drama are really “die beiden Urphänomene.” Little profit for the historical
student of poetry is to be found in essays like Veit Valentin’s “Poetische Gattungen,”
in <i>Zst. f. vgl. Litt.</i>, N. F., V. 35 ff.</p>

dreams about the dead, as productive of myth. Modern peasants, like savages,
often show a heavy and stupid indifference in the presence of death; and its
problem, though it doubtless suggested a cult of spirits, was far less insistent with
early man than the problem of life. Before he thus worked out a world of dead
spirits, he knew by instinctive, really unconscious inference, a world of living
spirits, not of his own breed, but vaster, subtler, in those operations of nature
which struck into his actual life, interfered with it, or conspicuously helped it.</p>

advanced was due to the study of poetical material alone, and had no help from
psychology. The latter, however, is quite favourable to the theory of poetic evolution
as stated in the text. See the quotations from Taine and others in the
essay of Dr. Buck. The false conclusions of Heinzel in regard to simile and
metaphor are of little moment compared with the general value of the essay which
contains them: <i>Ueber den Stil der altgermanischen Poesie</i>, Strassburg, Q. F.,

<div class='footnote' id='f1134'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r1134'>1134</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The subject is too wide for further treatment, and can be regarded here only
in its relations to the beginnings of poetry. See, however, for the early stages of
a metaphor, J. Grimm’s essay on “Die Fünf Sinne,” <i>Kleinere Schriften</i>, VII.
193 ff.; and F. Bechtel, <i>Ueber die Bezeichnungen der sinnlichen Wahrnehmungen
in den indogerm Sprachen</i>, Weimar, 1879, where he shows how the idea of
“bright” underlies so many of our words,—“glad,” for instance, which even in
Anglo-Saxon meant “gleaming.” See, too, in this book the confusion, or flexibility,
of words for the “bright” and the “loud,” seeing and hearing; also J.
Grimm, “Die Wörter des Leuchtens und Brennens,” <i>Kl. Schr.</i>, VIII. 263 ff.</p>

and like Vinesauf and others of earlier time, has an array of kennings whence
the poet may pick and choose. Abel, for example (pp. 221 ff.), you may call
“death’s first fruit,” or “death’s handsel.” Then there are “forms of invocating
Muses” (p. 630), followed, alas, by “forms of concluding letters”—in
prose.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r1141'>1141</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In this sketch of differentiation in poetic style only outlines are essayed.
The subject is uncommonly attractive, and a book on the history of metaphor
would be welcomed by all students of style. Nothing has been said here of symbolic
metaphor from animals and the like. See Brinkmann’s study of “Thierbilder
in der Sprache,” <i>Die Metaphern</i>, Bd. I. Bonn, 1878. His researches in German,
English, French, Spanish, Italian, Latin, Greek, should be extended to half civilized
and savage conditions, and should take a historical and genetic range. Of
course, the æsthetic side of this whole subject is treated in Gerber’s well known
book, quoted several times on preceding pages, <i>Die Sprache als Kunst</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f1142'>
<p class='c013'><span class='label'><a href='#r1142'>1142</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is noteworthy that Aristotle excludes improvisation from poetry; and in
modern times Gerber (<i>Die Sprache als Kunst</i>) finds this rude kind of verse so
opposed to his definition of poetry (“die Kunst des Gedankens,” <i>ibid.</i>, I. 50;
“enthusiasm plus deliberation,” I. 77), that he too rules it out, and says it belongs
simply to “the art of language.” It is not well to drag such a ball-and-chain by
way of definition when one is dealing with primitive poetry.</p>

in Blackwell’s <i>Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer</i>, pp. 104 ff. Limits

<i>Old English Ballads</i>, pp. 310 ff. Further, see Piper, <i>Spielmannsdichtung</i> (Vol. 2

the voice both for prose and for verse. The seventh chapter is on the “stanze

in this art (“essendo ancor fanciullo ... non arrivava ai sedici anni”), who
made verses off-hand on any subject which was given to him.</p>

the improvised flyting, even in its more complicated and artistic phases. Through
sundry references made above (pp. 208, note, 325, 416 f.) in regard to the interlaced
stanzas of ballad and song. I have come into a bit of unintentional and
quite explicable confusion. These <i>serranas</i> were called artificial, and yet were
cited in the proof of communal origins. Artistic and even artificial these <i>serranas</i>
undoubtedly become; and yet so does the refrain. They are very common;
as Professor Lang points out in his <i>Liederbuch des Königs Denis von Portugal</i>,
Halle, 1894, pp. xlvii, lxiii, they make “die Norm des altportugiesischen Kunstgedichtes,”
and are found alike in songs of love and in the various kinds of
flyting. Here, in the public song-duel, one crosses into communal territory; and
the <i>serranas</i> go back to that rivalry of variation based upon a refrain or a repeated
traditional verse.</p>

from the first edition, and not from the second, which came to my hands after
the foregoing chapters were printed. In bulk the book has more than doubled,
increase lying mainly in new songs and refrains of labour, particularly of <i>Bittarbeit</i>
and <i>Frohnarbeit</i>. Neither this new edition, however, nor the new edition of
Bücher’s <i>Entstehung der Volkswirthschaft</i> (see my note above, p. <a href='#Page_107'>107</a>) changes
materially his theory as quoted in defence of communal poetry. Not so much
the priority of play is conceded as the early lack of a definite boundary between
play and work. Again, references have been made above to Yrjö Hirn’s book,
<i>Förstudier till en Konstfilosofi</i>; this material, and much more of the sort, are now
to be found in the same author’s <i>Origins of Art</i>, London and New York, 1900.
Possibly some modification, due to the chapter on “Erotic Art,” should be made
in the statements of ethnologists with regard to the lack of this motive in savage
poetry.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
